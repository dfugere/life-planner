I fell off the wagon again. Tonight I went to buy a guitar. I said I wouldn't buy any more guitar. I'm happy with it. It's a pretty good bargain, but 300 bucks. But I wasted a lot of time. It took me at least an hour and a half to go get it. No, an hour 15 actually, to go get it. So yeah, it was a waste of time. And no, actually more than that. It took me an hour 45. Crazy. Wasted time. And I wasted a lot of time on YouTube and on Facebook today. I didn't sleep well last night and it was really hard to concentrate. So I kind of wasted a day. Spent so much time on marketplace. I'm deleting the app tomorrow again. I'm done, hopefully. But I'm getting stressed, falling behind at work. It's kind of a pattern coming back. I need to be there for myself and help myself now. Time to rise up.

So I wanted to make sure I logged in sometime, some journal entry today. I just want to make sure I do it every day.
