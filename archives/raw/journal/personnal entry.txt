Personal journal entry, just an insight today about a video I saw Dr. K or something on YouTube say that you have to look at yourself through time as different people so if you're being lazy today you're kind of setting the future you for pain because like if you decide to binge and not clean then the future you is gonna wake up tomorrow and the apartment is gonna be all all dirty and and he's gonna hate your guts for it and maybe hate himself because he's gonna think it's him so I'm kind of right now dealing with what the past me left me which is a pretty much a wasteland I have a great family I can say I like the relationship love relationship is strained because I'm my business is $200,000 in debt and I'm personally at least maybe $60,000 in debt so we're kind of in pain and that's been left by the past me now all I can do about that is recognize that the behavior that the past me had is not gonna help the future me have a good life so what I can do is today I'm gonna work for future me to make sure he has a better life and future family and mainly future me because I know if future me has a better life then it means my my old family has a better life so in the present I'm setting myself to a better financial future that's my main goal okay that's it for today for this morning
