I had a good day at work, pretty focused. I had a meeting at far where I have for which I had to finish something important for the client and It went well. I finished what I had to do and using mainly AI so Yeah, I wanted to make sure I wasn't doing it manually, but Getting better at AI then send the video to the client I'm happy about my work day spent some time on internet content actually a Bit distracted, but not too bad Maybe lost an hour and all but through that I spent some time on LinkedIn and I saw the competitor and how everything was going and it motivated me so But at the same time he Scares me now. I'm really hungry and this it's hard to focus so I'll go eat something and get back to work afterwards.

 I just realized I get really unfocused when someone else is here. I'm using  speech to text to  log my work and log ideas. And when somebody else is speaking in the house, I get totally unfocused. It's like I have a kind of fear and I'm shy of just doing my work. So I need to find a way to remind myself of that because it certainly makes me unproductive. And also find a way to either do it anyways or find a way to work around it.
