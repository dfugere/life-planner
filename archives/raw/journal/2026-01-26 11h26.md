 I've got to stop feeling helpless and realize I have access to as much resources as anyone in the world. It just depends on what I focus on, what I apply myself to. I can look at my financial resources, what I have available right now, and what I can get more of, where I can get more of, and how I can make it grow and compound. If I focus on that vision, accounting for the resources I have, the debt I have, the current state of things, and started to really focus on gaining more. There's no reason I can't get like a lot more. The only reasons are psychological. They're mental hurdles, emotional hurdles. It's nothing real. If I just focus in on executing this project, removing the emotional limits I put on myself, and the hallucinations I'm afraid of, there's no real limit.
