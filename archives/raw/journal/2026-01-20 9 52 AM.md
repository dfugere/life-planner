 So this morning, I, like actually last night, I didn't sleep well at all. Between four and six hours, I fell asleep around one and got woken up by my phone at five because the server RM dispatch went down. But it happens every morning. So I should do something about that.

So it doesn't wake me up every morning. And then I had problem falling back asleep until seven. I kind of was in and out of sleep. So I wasn't really sleeping.

So that's, yeah, four to six hours. So I'm pretty tired today. It will be hard. I have to be careful.

I have to keep my phone away and maybe rely on AI to keep me back on track because this helps me. So yeah, I have to be conscious of that. I have to bring my daughters to school. And we, when I came back, I sang in the car for 15 minutes.

It's always hard in the morning and it's even harder when I haven't, when I haven't slept much to sing. So my voice like, it was really hard actually. So I don't know. I have to, I have to give myself some kind of, kind of a better practice ritual so I can warm up.

I'm getting better for sure. I'm getting better at the beat and the, like, I get the high notes a lot easier than I used to. I really like my process with the small recorder to record myself with the background music in the car. It's like, it makes the car ride a lot more enjoyable.

And, and I get better at singing too. So, so that's, that's just, I just found some more time in my day. and like, good thing this morning, I did, 30 minutes of, of cleaning up because, the kitchen was really messy. Yeah. I want to talk to Julie cause we need to, we need to get better at cleaning at night with the girls right now.

They're not helping enough. So, and right now when I asked them to help Julie always intervenes and helps like she's kind of, she wants to watch TV with them instead of cleaning. So that pisses me off and she knows it pisses me off. So I don't know.

We have to find a, we had a great night yesterday, but, I have to find, we have to find a strategy to make sure we clean up more, all positive stuff. And, yeah, okay. So morning I sang, I cleaned up, journaled. I plan on journaling for only 10 minutes, but, had problems with my new, journaling system through cloud, co-work.

This didn't really work well. So, cause, it didn't find the right, it, it thought we were still in this session from last night. So it thought it was, still midnight. And when I told him to look at the right, to look at the, to not use the cash and look at the, the date from the common line and asked him why he told me excuses, like, because it was, the date was in UTC and like was bullshit.

So I was pissed at it. So that doesn't really work. Like it's this AI, even know that it's the best. It's really not intelligent.

I just realized, I'm using Sonnet instead of a cloud. That sucks. instead of a, Opus 4.5. Okay. So now I'm planning like it's, 9 52 AM, January 20th. I have a big day ahead of me.

I'm stressed about work. I have to organize my stuff, get back to clients, big day ahead. But, with AI, I'm really more, enthusiastic. 

So today, no Facebook Marketplace at all. Zero, nitch nada. And no YouTube. If I watch YouTube, it will be only to get some tutorials about using AI just to get some inspiration. That's it. I want to maximize my generative AI use today for coding and improving my processes.
