Remember the rat experiment? They were giving rats in the lab, they were giving cocaine to the rats. When the rat was hitting some button in his cage, there's a button he was hitting and it would give him cocaine, like water with cocaine or something. So he got really addicted, like addicted to the point where he wouldn't do anything and he would stop eating and only hit that button and get some hits. And then they stopped giving him the cocaine when he was hitting the button. And then after a while he started eating again and started being normal and not going back to the button. And the button wasn't working. And so he became normal for a long time and he wasn't going to the button anymore because it wasn't giving him anything. And then at one point, they would electrocute the rat and he would run to the button and start hitting it again non-stop. So yeah, that's kind of a metaphor for when I get scared. Even if I stop looking at Facebook or YouTube, if I get stressed, I'm going to want to go back to my addiction. So the brain pathway is still there even if I don't have the habit in the latest weeks. So it's something I really have to keep in mind. I'm going to be weak for years for sure with that drug. So I really need to disconnect totally. Just a reminder.
