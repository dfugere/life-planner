I just want to take a mental note of what important thing I was just thinking about is that I'm pretty hard on myself and I compare myself to a lot of people my age that are making a lot more money and that have more success financially and professionally. And I'm also panicking about my competitors in business and seeing that I'm not doing enough. There's more potential for me professionally. I don't know actually, I don't know if it's good or bad. I think it's okay, but it needs to be something positive. I need to just tell myself maybe, okay, this is possible, so why can't I do it? I can do it. And then maybe it should help me actually focus on my strengths and weaknesses and true objectives, like how do I want to contribute? How do I want to help the world? And so I can just gain more momentum by being conscious of what are my blind spots, my weaknesses that I have to be aware of and what are my strengths that I have to lean on to get more leverage. And that compared to other people, but compared to how I want to help the world, because in the end my insight was more that I don't act nice necessarily because I don't help as much people as I could help. But the reason I want to do all the things I want to do is to contribute in a way. I don't want to do everything for myself. I want to gain skills and abilities that I can share. But the problem is I never feel I'm good enough in those skills so I can share them. And I think that's a problem. I'm not contributing. I can contribute more actually. And my main goal is really contribution through my specific abilities, in my own way, following my own path, out of the beaten path.
