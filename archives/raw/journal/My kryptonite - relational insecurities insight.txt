I realized I have some human interaction friction, I guess, like right now I'm brainstorming and building really fast, like I'm just shooting out all my ideas to OpenClaw and it's building them for me and I envision like everything that's gonna happen from it and like if I just do it like building myself using OpenClaw without thinking of my human interactions I'm gonna have during the process of building it, then it seems really fluid in my head and I don't see any friction ahead and I see how it can be implemented. But as soon as I think of how I'm gonna explain it to people, like I was thinking I have to tell that to Nicolas, my employee, and just the process of thinking of how I'm gonna tell him and then from experience knowing that he might not understand it right away and he might not be that open to it and he might criticize some aspects of it, it makes me stop right like in my tracks and freeze and it's like I want to just stop working on the project. I think that's a really important insight because I have to find a way to do things even if people don't understand them, to just do things and send them in the open, send them in the wild, show them to people and don't wait for their reaction to it, just do it without caring the reaction of people. Because now, because I feel with Nicolas because he's, and it's like this is a specific human interaction I have in terms of software development and my like the way I see myself as a software developer or software engineer. I have some insecurities, I've had them since the beginning, since even when I left university. I've always thought people were better than me, so I at the same time I think my solutions are better, I see myself as better, but when I speak to people I don't want to look better, I don't want to sound arrogant or anything, so I delegate the decision to them and because I always think if people are engineers they're always more like they nerd out more than me and they seem more nerd than me, so I guess they they're thinking more than me, but it's not necessarily the same thing because the way my my brain works is I see logical abstract concepts and sometimes they're more straight to the point and simpler and better. I think Nicolas, the way he works is he's nerd in terms of his infrastructure, not his system, but the way he likes his work environment to be, like he likes things to be neatly organized and to feel professional and to feel he's doing a good job and me, all that thing, I don't care, I prefer the idea itself and the abstraction itself and the logic itself. I want to get there as soon as possible and all the my work environment and everything, it could be anything, it could be a paper, it could be and it's always messed up, so it's two different things, but the problem is I have an insecurity about that and I feel I'm less professional, but in a sense I'm more professional because I'm I'm getting at the solution and I want to implement the solution, so yeah that's that's and that's just one insecurity because at the same time if I think of how I'm gonna show and talk to this about, I talked to this project to Julie, my girlfriend, then she's gonna not understand and because it's kind of abstract, so I can't talk to her about it either because she's gonna say okay now is it just into something stupid, something else, because I've talked to her a bunch about Bitcoin and then I talked to her about a bunch about music and and finances and I always go too deep, I talked to her about MBTI and 16 personalities and union psychology and it's always too far, too much, too deep, so she's just gonna think I'm diving too deep into something else and it's not really worth coming with me because it's just me and the way I am, so yeah that that was just an insight I had of how when I'm into a project I don't have to speak, talk to it, to people about it because talking to them about it, it's kind of at the same time hoping for a reaction so the talking to people about it has to be a kind of, it has to be a performance, it doesn't, it can't be a dialogue, it can't be a conversation, it has to be a performance, it has to be like, so what are you working on and then I show them without caring what they think about it but I have to show them a part of me, like this quirky part of me that's building those crazy projects and that are having those crazy thoughts and I have to show them with a smile, this is how quirky I am and not care at all of their input, at all, except, it depends, maybe someday some people are gonna say oh that's so amazing I want to work with you on that and I have to be careful because I don't want to bring on anybody that's just gonna stop me in my tracks because I know Nicolas stops me in my tracks all the time because I'm gonna give him, but it depends, it really depends because I have to see it the right way with him too, I know when I give him stuff that I thought about and that's well thought, he's gonna love it, he's gonna say wow that's good logic, I love it but and he's gonna like to clean it up and I hate cleaning it up but he's gonna say wow I love this project, I love this logic and he's gonna clean it up and make it all good and he's gonna be proud of himself because he cleaned it up and now it's fun to work in this project because it's easy to understand, it's all organized and stuff and he used a good, some cool patterns that he could try, so yeah if we do it that way it's gonna work but I can't let him think about the big idea of it, that's he's gonna get lost and he doesn't like it, so I guess it can be really constructive but I have to keep in mind where my insecurities can be touched and like where I can be stopped in my track, what's my, what's my, how do you call it for Superman, what's my kryptonite actually, it's these, it's these insecurities.
