I'm really tired again today yesterday I said I would go to sleep early but by the time I decided to go to sleep I did a bit of work then I said we needed to do the dishes then I don't know what I did but I ended up going to sleep at 12 30 and like midnight how do you say midnight 30 12 30 so maybe I fell asleep around 1 so woke up at 7 15 and that's really not enough sleep for me like when I sleep less than seven hours it's extremely hard to concentrate and remain on task on the single project so I haven't done much this today so far I did have a productive meeting with Nicola and answer some clients but I didn't do what I was supposed to do so I'll try and just keep that in mind and refocus on the real priorities it's not easy because there's so much stuff that needs to be done so like it's really hard to or just that I want to do so it's really hard to put everything aside and doing boring stuff like fixing my financials so I also need to get back to two clients like in a hurry it's Saguenay Aventure and and Twango for passion a ski so I'll do that then it's really hard not to work on my business management framework and because I feel every minute I'm not leveraging AI to do more job I'm getting behind but the most important work at the moment is really the financials so I get back to this as I'm saying this I also have a bunch of FOMO of networking on the sales process and starting to cold call clients or prospects so okay I'll focus on my financials once this I feel I have momentum on this I can move to the other ones of course after I answer the questions to clients I have that are an emergency
