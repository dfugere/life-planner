Another small reminder for myself is I have to focus in terms of the pillar of self-esteem where that applies to integrity, purpose I guess, live consciously, and self-acceptance. Actually, it applies to all of them because it's my responsibility. And then self-assertion, what is me? So really, where should my focus be? Right now, I'm just feeling I'm all over the place, all the time. I need to focus on focus, that's for sure. Get more focus in. Trying to delete, remove the hooks for sure. Okay, that's it.
