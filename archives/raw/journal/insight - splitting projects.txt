Okay so this is just a reminder, just some insight, splitting a project, whatever project, into really really small easily achievable tasks is the secret recipe for me. Else everything becomes too complicated. I see every possibility all the time. It's like it's the same reason like when I start to do something, like if I go repair a guitar or just do anything downstairs like in the basement, like 10 minutes after I'm there I look around and everything is messy and I just leave everything all around because it's like I'm so disorganized. There's possibilities everywhere all the time so if I can just know the plan and just do the steps without thinking then it's the magic recipe as I said. So just reminder, anything that seems too big I just need to decarticate it into or split it into really small steps, each one achievable by a grandmother or by anyone that doesn't have to think to do it. That's a goal.
