Okay, so my goal for the... I'm actually really enthusiastic about AI because I truly believe it can help me manage or get a lot better with my executive dysfunction. Right now I'm surely... I surely have an executive dysfunction and so my goal is to is to get everything out, like what's in my head, so that I can see at least for myself that I can at least see if it's... if my goals and my ambitions are achievable and if not, then focus on what is achievable and make some, like if it's necessary, make some sacrifice and decide, choose the priorities I really want to focus on. For now, what I think is possible and I hope is possible, it's mostly what I think and I believe it's possible, is I want to make my company successful, to help as many people as possible manage their businesses through our software and to make the job of managing the business of our clients a lot easier and more fun through the automation we provide them. So that's one, it's make business successful by making our clients more successful, by delivering a lot more, by getting more known, having a lot more clients, having a really fast and easy onboarding process, automating all the invoicing and accounting, making it fun actually, using my ideas and problem-solving for the goods of our customers, at scale, using product and automations. So that's one of the things I want to do, but at the same time I'm still, I still want to make progress and keep my artistic aptitude relevant and I want to sharpen that, so I want to like, I really like playing music with my band, I really like singing, there's something, it's like playing a game, like practicing songs, it's really like playing a game, like I would do that non-stop, all the time. When I start practicing a song, it's all I want to do, it's really all I want to do, so I would do that like for 15 hours straight for sure, if that, if I was paid to do that, I would do that all the time and I love practicing actually, I love the, just getting better, practicing and even if it's hard, even if I'm not getting better sometimes, I love the process. So I'll keep practicing music, what I want in the upcoming six months, what I want to work on is to have a system that that my setup is already done, I just get in and start practicing like at the highest level possible, like I warm up, then I start practicing at the highest level, I already have my mic, my speakers and I can, I can sing songs with my guitar and just practice as if I was in a studio or with a live band and get good, get really good, get comfortable, so I think even 20 minutes a day makes a huge difference, because I have already a really good memory, I'm good at remembering songs and so, so it just compounds and it's really, it's really fun and great to look back and see all the songs I've learned and that now I know for, maybe for the rest of my life, so, so that's one thing, making sure I have a system for practicing, because making sure and then integrating the other practices, I want to draw, like at first maybe five minutes a day is okay, I want to start practicing, like I already saved up some videos on YouTube of drawing practices, so my first step is to go through like, there's one video that's 25 practices and the first step is to actually do the 25 practices, then get to know them, to know them or at least have a page where I have a list of them and I can just pick any, any one of them and do five minutes a day, like if I do that for the next six months, I'll be really, really, really happy, five minutes a day is enough, but eventually I want to get to 10 minutes, 20 minutes a day, because I feel drawing is something that I really loved when I was young and I know I still love it, it's just that there's some psychological barrier that stops me from drawing, you know, it's kind of idealizing it, it's kind of, I see it as too big, it's, I have a talent, so I can't make a mistake and that's what, that's what I don't want to happen, I actually want to, I want to make the practice and then the failure and the mistakes the good thing, I just want the practice to be the thing I'm focusing on, so for now that's it, I don't have to go further, take the 25, take the 25 training exercises and do them five minutes a day, pick one and do it five minutes a day for the next six months, that's my goal, I'll do it. Next, the other one is, so I have drawing, singing and playing guitar, some music, then like acting, because acting is something that I know makes me really feel alive, like performing in front of people really makes me feel alive and I get to feel something inside myself that there's no other way that I can feel, so I'd like to, right now I don't know how I can, I can add this to my life because it's already pretty busy, but I'd like to keep that in mind, just so I can add this practice to in my daily life, like some acting somehow, I don't know how, but some acting, yeah, because I just love to do it for fun, I act anyways with my family, I do some acting, they find me strange, but I love to do characters and stuff, so yeah, for now this is the one that's not set in stone in terms of how I practice it, but at least within the next six months I'd like to have an idea of how I can sustainably incorporate an acting practice where I practice for a specific performance or something, like what I think right now, the only thing I have in mind is maybe start doing more videos for my company with my face on it, because that's not really acting, but it's still a type of performance, so, and this scares me a bunch, so I guess I should focus on it if it scares me, and I think it's a good, it would be a good thing, so yeah, I'd like to start doing videos for my clients actually, but I don't put it as a top priority, because I've already have a bunch of, like I have my work cut out for me already, so so this is just a thought, a thought like if there's opportunity, if I see a video that needs to be done, maybe I should not hesitate and try to do it, but like right now the only thing that keeps me from doing it is actually the process of making sure the image is good, and having the camera set up, and making sure the sound is good, and I think it's a bit too much work, so we'll see, I'll let it go for now, this is one I'll let go for now. So right now is a main, if I go back, main priority growing my business sustainably, and yes, growing my business, doing music, and drawing five minutes a day, then eating healthy, that it just says it all, eating healthy, right now it's pretty simple, like I have a, I look at the the site, how not to die, and they have a daily dozen, which is for the 12 12 food that, 12 items that I should eat every day, if I eat that every day I'm good, so that the system is right there, so just follow the system, and so health, health and yeah, I want to incorporate better sleep too, so go to sleep 10 30, everything shuts down, I can read and then that's it, maybe I could record some stuff on my recorder, so I can put it in my journal the day after, so that's it, that's easy, then next sports, yeah I want to, I wanted to ski more this week, this winter, but I'm not doing it, because I tried to work, although I did a lot of procrastination, yeah, so I wasn't organized enough, let's say, to go skiing more, but I like to ski once a week during the winter, to go for, right now my main exercise is seven minutes of, seven exercises, mobility exercises I do every morning, if I stick to that, like for the next three months, I'll be happy, like that, that's what I want to focus on, for now, start, start slow, and build the practice, build the system, so that's it for exercise for now, I'd like to, and I think it'd be a good thing to integrate, 10 minutes walk outside, while talking to my, to my journal, and while journaling, 10 minutes walk outside would be good, so I'll integrate that for sure, because I already journal anyways, sitting at my desk, so I'll integrate a 10 minutes walk journaling outside, yeah for sure, maybe bring my dog, and the next one is, like I'm already working on it, because doing my mobility exercise is good for surfing, for my surfing, so the next one is actually, this summer I really want to go surf in the Lachine Rapids, at least once a week, for a few reasons, it's one for the experience itself, like it's an amazing wave, it's a great place to surf, the second one is to see people, to see friends, like I'm kind of, I like to be by myself, think and do like practice music and stuff like that, and and I don't see my surf friends enough, and I've been out of the loop for a while, so like my friend had kids and I haven't seen his kid, and I didn't even like congratulate him, so at this point can you say it's a friend, I don't know, it's like I cut a bunch of people out of my life, and I like those people, I'd like to see them more, and I think this is like two birds and one stone, you know, I I live this amazing surfing experience in the Lachine Rapids, and at the same time I see the guys, but yeah, maybe one time a week is a bit hectic, is a bit too much, like that would be the ideal, but once every two weeks is doable, so I'll do that, and when I go there, I'll go by bicycle, so yeah, that's amazing that I'll do that, and the other one is my personal finance, a really important one, it should actually be at the top with my business finances, but my business finances impacts my personal finance a lot, because if my business gains value, then my network, net worth actually gets a lot bigger, and yeah, I want like the practice of venturing forth and getting out, for me that's also helping people, and doing things for people, so I really like this, and I want to do this through my business, so helping a lot more people, how do I do that? I get seen, I make sure they know about us, so yeah, I'll do my business sales plan, but the main thing is to, one, be as automated, as systemized as possible, so that when they know about us, and when they meet us, and when they interface with us, it's seamless, and it's pleasurable, and it's awesome, and first, that they know about us too, and that we get talked about in the right way, in the positive manner, so, and the other one is the family for sure, but I'm spending a lot of time already with the family right now, the family takes a lot of time, so I don't want to spend less time, I think it's great the way it's going, I just want to make sure the other, the other things are systemized, so that I can incorporate them in a productive way, and there's mental health, so like journaling, I think it's going to help a lot, accountability is going to help a lot, but like, I'm still addicted to my phone, I'm still addicted to Marketplace and YouTube, as soon as I open them, I get there, I get stuck, and I can't delete them, it's like, it's sticking in my brain, and there's always the phone mode that that gets stuck there, so this part of it, it's really important, it's important that I talk about it, it's, what I want to do to fix it, is to make sure delete those, make sure delete those those apps, and I'll actually take the time to make the list of the people that I think are interesting, and that should be, that I should be listening to, and ask my AI assistant to to update me on what they're saying, like what's, what's the information I'm missing, that I'm afraid I'm missing out, like as an example, there are a few guys in investing that, they seem to be always right, and they have a good, like good arguments, like I think of Tom Lee, Luke Groman, on the short term, there's a Derek Soloway, there's a CTO Larson, that's amazing, because he has a, he has actually a, how do you call it, an indicator, that's really good, a blue line indicator, so I think that would be, like those guys, I want to know what they are, and the dumb money guys also, I want to know what they're saying, like what's new for them, there's Lyn Alden also, the other ones, they're too, they're into the hype, and they're not as good, I think, those are, oh there's a Tom Nash, I think he's really good, he has some really good stock picks, and there's another guy, I don't remember his name, but he always has really good stock picks, so so yeah, I'd like them to be, like summarized daily, and if there's anything new, and there's anything worth acting on, then that would have, I would have the notification without having to myself listen to all the videos they do, or look at the tweets and stuff, there's also the new AI trends, so other guys, I don't remember the list, but I look at it, like what's new, and what's important, and what I should be trying out, like this week, there's a open claw that came out, and like I'm really happy, I jumped on it, and tried it, because it's actually a great tool, so yeah, I want to keep on the cutting edge, adding some best practices, or new cutting edge practices to my to my expertise, and practice, to better serve my clients, and better improve my own organization, so I think that's it, I think it's really like technical, like AI programming trends, and and investing in economies, the rest is not important, like news and stuff, I don't care, I really don't care, it's just noise, and like news about health, and stuff like that, it's not, we already know a bunch of it, like the science is pretty good, so I can use the science that's already there, and not worry about it, I don't have to waste time on it, and the other thing is a freaking marketplace, marketplace is it's getting to me all the time, like last week I found last week I found a really, really good speaker, that I never knew I would I would have had, because it was too expensive normally, but some girl, like I opened marketplace, and some girl was selling it for 100 bucks, I was like okay, I'll take it, if you give it to me, I'll take it, so I bought this speaker, really good, and today there's another guy that sells the new version of it for more money, but still really inexpensive, he sells it for 280, I bought it for 280, and I can sell the one I I bought for 100, I can sell it for 250, so it's like I have the new version for 120, that's crazy, it's a really, really, really amazing deal, and I needed that speaker actually, to practice, I didn't really need it, but yes, I kind of needed it, if I want to make my practice easier, more fluid, then it's just really good, and then I see there's a guy selling a big PA setup, that we could use with our band, and it's really cheap, it's 800 bucks, but and I'm trying to get it for 600, so I could sell a bunch of it, a part of it, so I could just keep the stands and the sub, and I would have it for a bargain price, and you know, I can just grow my inventory of musical stuff by founding deals, but the thing is, is when I start finding too good deals, I get addicted, I'm just thinking, I have to look at it more, I have to look at it more, then I waste so much time on it, so I'd like to automate that, ask my AI agent to go on my Facebook account, see the list of everything I've bought so far, like what I'm interested in, see the prices and bid on it, when it's a good price, and it's not far, so I can have more opportunities to have more cheap, free inventory, without wasting my time on Facebook, I guess I still want more good music accessories, like I'm almost done, I almost have everything I want, actually a big subwoofer for my band, for the PA system, would be amazing, I think that's it. Does that cover it? For now, yeah, the other thing is family, yeah, family and the house ordering, like it's really something I'm not doing enough, I want to be good, I want to get good at it, like feel good at it, I want something to be something I'm practicing, like actively, thinking, okay today did I, like at the end of the day thinking, was I proactive in ordering everything, was everything ordered today, like was I efficient, effective in cleaning everything, was everything as organized as possible, or did I just mess everything up, because just an example is our basement, our garage, it's a freaking mess, and the reason it's a mess, is because I start doing something, I take some stuff out of where they were stored, and leave them on the floor, or at some stupid place, and then I go do something else, and then when I come back, like right now, everything is all over the place, it's a total mess, so yeah, I want to start the practice of having a specific place for everything, and if something doesn't have its specific place, it might be because we don't use it enough, and we don't need it, so we have to get rid of it, or I just haven't made time to organize it, but this organization thing needs to be like top of my mind, because it's wasting a lot of mental energy, when I see the mess all the time, I feel like drained, but when it's clean, I feel more, a lot more enthusiastic about doing what I have to do, so yeah, the practice of ordering everything all the time, not like sometimes at the end of the day, I want to order everything all the time, things need to be where where they're assigned to, and do that in harmony, like be pleasurable with my family, and don't be, don't lose temper, I want to work on my temper to actually be more be more mindful of my emotions, I think the last thing would be, I'd like to, for the next six months, I'd say, I'll say five minutes, do five minutes of meditation, I can't do that, it's not hard, but the reason is, if I do ten, five minutes, oftentimes I'll do ten minutes, but at least I'll have done it, so five minutes at least of meditation a piece of meditation a day, I think that covers it, I think that covers it.
