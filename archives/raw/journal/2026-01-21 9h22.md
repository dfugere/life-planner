I'm happy about my day of yesterday for the work I've done and the improvement I've done using AI. Now, today, it's normal, the beginning of the day. I'm always a bit lost, so I will go in my dashboard for my business planner to get started. This morning, I did my exercise, like seven minutes, that's good. It's mobility exercise I want to do every day. I cleaned up, practiced singing warm-up, got the coffee, got dressed for work, and I'm ready to go. It's a bit later than I would want. I feel kind of a bit anxious. I looked at my calendar and when there are some meetings in my calendar, sometimes it messes with my mind. It gets me disoriented. I'm anxious about some things I need to send to clients, but I'll log this in my business journal, actually. For the rest, I personally did the right thing. I got enough sleep, maybe seven hours of sleep, so that's good. I want to do at least nine hours of work today again. I know it's a lot, and I'd like to do that. During the day at lunch, I'll go practice, maybe not at lunch because I have meetings beforehand. At lunch, it'll be good. I'll go practice maybe an hour of music for the songs I'm trying to get right with my band. I'm working on the ones I have problems with right now. Kids aren't alright from offspring. The other ones are pretty good. Make sure I delete my apps, my distracting apps from my phone. This morning, I actually did look at YouTube a little too much, but I did learn some important stuff about using AI for coding. I guess it was productive. I'll think about it. Anyways, going to work now.
