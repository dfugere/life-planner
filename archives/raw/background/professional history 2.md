So to continue my professional path, I was talking about when I was in university. I was in university. At that time, I was working. When I got into university, right before, I was working as a captain for the small boats, like 90-people boats.

I had to do a one-week formation to be a captain for a touristic boat on the Lac des Sables in Sainte-Lac-de-Mont. It was great, good experience. I was lucky to have that. And I was good at it.

Then I went to university. Actually, I had some good grades in CJET, but maybe not good enough. I don't remember exactly, but I went actually one semester to university. I had a degree certificate that you call.

It's kind of a... If you do three certificates, then you have a bachelor's degree in liberal arts. So I did a certificate in computer science. And I kind of had momentum because I wanted to have a good math grade in CJET.

So I had studied... I had started studying well before the exams. And I had good grades in maths and CJET. So I actually... When I started the certificate, I started studying really, really well and doing my homework really well.

I was kind of starting to be a nerd. And I got crazy grades. Like in maths, I think from university. I think I had 98 or something like that.

It was really good. So I was happy with that. And when I started like Sherbrooke University, my bachelor's degree in computer science, I had the momentum and I told myself, okay, now I'm a nerd. Now I'm studying. I want to have good grades.

And that's what I did. And I had really good grades. I had really good grades. I was good. I was around... Was it four? I don't remember. It was more than three...

Three point four, I think. It wasn't too good, but it was good. And I wasn't studying all the time. I thought I could do better.

It was still hard for me to study. I still felt I had ADHD. But I was doing my homeworks and I was... Most homeworks, actually. I couldn't do my COBOL homework because I thought it was too stupid of a language.

I thought it was worthless. I couldn't do it. I just copied it. But the other, like the math problems and stuff, I was pretty good.

And at that time, I had forgotten about... Not forgotten, but... I started being shy again. I forgot about theater and drawing. At least I was playing music with my new friends who were also playing music.

And that was a lot of fun. We weren't serious about music. We would just play at home. But I should have started a band.

Because I felt I was really creative at that time. Like I had a bunch of song ideas. So, yeah. At university, at first I was really into it. Two first sessions, really into it.

Great. Then the new call. But I didn't see myself as a computer nerd. That's kind of the problem. I didn't see myself as a computer nerd.

So, I thought I was not as good as the other ones. But in retrospect, I could have been as good or better than the other ones. You know, I was just not nerding out on the same thing. You know? Because I... You know, I hate setting up a computer or setting up stuff.

But I loved the logic of solving, like creating a software for something. I loved it. Like I loved the pseudocoding and thinking about the logic for me was a lot of fun. And I was really good in like pure software theory. I was really good.

Like math, software theory, Boolean logic. I was really good. Not using the computer itself. I thought there was too like C++.

I thought it was too verbose. It was better than Cobalt. You know, too verbose. I didn't love it at all.

And yeah, I sold myself short actually. I should have gone to better internships. Because I went to a management software internship. And I did some basic management software.

And it was okay. But not that fun, you know? And it was okay. I could do it.

But it wasn't that fun. And I think I went there two semesters. And I went to... I went to space agency.

And I didn't do shit during their whole internship. I didn't do anything. At all. I didn't program one line of code. I don't know why.

I was... I was bored. I think it's kind of a... It's still a question of the way I saw myself. Now, at 47, like, I think those problems would interest me. Because I know I've solved some hard problems.

So, I think I could do a good job. But at the time, I kind of saw it as complicated. And I thought it wasn't for me. Yeah. I thought I was more of an artist.

But at the same time, I wasn't asserting myself in anything. I wasn't doing much. So, I was just procrastinating anything. I was so much in my head.

I was so... It was so hard to focus. So, yeah. I didn't do anything at that internship. I still got a good grade for some reason. I don't know why.

Then, yeah. The other internships were actually just management software. And that was it. All my friends, they went to 3D programming and game programming and stuff like that. And I think I...

In retrospect, it was... I was setting myself short and not pushing enough. Because I didn't see myself as a programmer. It was something... Yeah. I thought I wasn't nerd enough.

But I was actually good enough. If you look at my grades compared to theirs. And I often found the proof for the PRNs faster than them. So, I was plenty good enough.

And when I started work after school, I found some work in a transportation company. I did some management programming. We were building their software. And I was finding that everything we were doing was really redundant.

Like doing a class for every table. And as soon as I started that, I had the thought that I should be generating all the code instead of doing it. It was stupid. And I got bored pretty fast. And one day, except for one day that like an emergency happened.

A new guy deleted the log of a database while it was transferring. And there was no backup and the database was lost for like weeks. So, the only thing we could do is like... I found on the...

Then I got into my own actually. I stepped up. And I found a solution. I looked online. I found a solution. And like somebody said, like there was a script you could do and run it.

And get the data back. So, I actually... I did it. And it was crazy because we were there all night. I was there all night coding and fixing the records. And the day after, I was fixing everything.

And I was kind of the star of the show because I did a good job. And I felt I was really focused, really, really good. Because it was a life or death. Like we had lost the data for more than a month for the company. It was crazy.

And then I got it back pretty much. And then I... Like I remember buying the software from the internet. So, I was like, that's cool. I should do those kind of software that people just buy on the internet.

So, like a few months later, I left. And I started reading about the internet marketing for selling software online. And that was in 2004. No, 2003, actually. 2003. So, and I left because I was too bored.

And I wanted to go work by myself. Because I didn't like the technology that was... That my... That we were using. I thought it was too verbose.

It was Java. But I didn't really... I thought it was too heavy. And I didn't see the point. So, I started trying to find some contracts.

But I never did any marketing online. I was kind of too shy and scared. So, I never did it. 24 years later... No, actually, 22 years later, I still haven't done it.

And still... And this was the gold rush, actually. I know so many people that were so rich. By just playing that arbitrage game with doing Facebook publicity or Google publicity. And it's still on.

We can still do it. There's still some arbitrage if we have a good business. So, I still want to get into it. So, then I got...

I went to work for... I went to work at a bar for a summer. And I was studying programming. Studying a bunch of things.

And I got lost in tutorial health. And I found a contract of a guy that had his office in the same place I live. And he gave me some contracts. And then he thought I was good.

So, he found me a bigger contract, which was a fixed amount for a software. $10,000 to build a software. And he sent a consultation agency to do the design, information design of the client. But I told him I should have been there. I should be there to understand the processes of the client.

And I wasn't there. So, they just sent me a shitty design that I couldn't understand. Like, there was no way I could have understood that. But anyways, afterwards, I went there.

Understood their processes and started building the software. I didn't have the experience. And I shouldn't have done it. But it ended up like...

I worked on it for more than a year. And it was spaghetti hell. And no test. But I did kind of a good job. It was kind of a cool software.

But really hacked together with the . NET technology. I decided I would use that. And so, that was just $10,000. And then I ran out of mine from there.

Because I went to... When I started my company, I had a subsidy, which was the same amount as the job insurance. And for a year. And then I ran out because the contract was too long.

And then we had a contract in 2000... The end of 2006, we had a contract for... Or the beginning of 2006, we had a contract for building a new transportation software for a company that... For the guy that had hired me at the other transportation job I had.

And so, I founded a business with a guy called Benjamin. And I didn't know at all. So, I just... Like, he was a French guy. Really bright. And really good. Like, he built kind of the core of the software.

And I was more like... He's an INTJ. So, he's really good at focusing and building stuff really fast. And I'm good at finding the holes and fixing the holes and finding new technologies. So, I decided... Like, I showed him a new technology that was Ruby on Rails.

It was really good because I was always doing research. And I thought, this is better than anything because it has MPC. It uses active records. So, yeah. I was... I buy that... At that point, I was really nerding out on technology.

I was better than a bunch of guys. But at the same time, I wasn't a nerd. So, yeah. I was so much not a nerd. When I... At that time, we went into programming groups and stuff.

And one guy said, who's that guy? He looks like a rock star. And yeah. You know, I was picking up girls and I looked like a rock star. I looked good and everything.

I still had a dream of being an actor and doing music. But I wasn't practicing. I was really selling myself short on all points. I wasn't practicing. But now I know I would have loved practicing more.

I was shy. I thought it kind of made me too vulnerable. And I had an armor, psychological armor, insecurities. I had kind of strong belief mixed with insecurities that was bad. So, I was not making choices.

The choices I knew I should be making. I was not jumping from the... If you look at the analogy of a bird flying off the nest. That's kind of what I never did, actually.

I wasn't jumping. I was sitting down near your ledge. Like, this computer science thing is a secure thing to do. But it's not. Because I'm clearly not a... I'm an entrepreneur in terms that I don't accept the status quo.

And I want to innovate. I'm a good innovator. I'm good at building solutions. But not that the managing stuff.

It's like... I've been, since then, like diagnosed with ADHD. Which is totally... Like, once you know it, it's like, oh yeah. For sure. I am. But, yeah. We started the company. And at first, it went well.

Because we had this big contract. And brought money. And then we found some other contracts. And we made it work. All that time, I was building a bunch of stuff.

But never, like, committing to... Like, I always had ideas. And we were building software on the intern. We could have sold a SaaS software for sure.

But we never sold it. I was always too afraid to sell it. So we never... We delivered for clients for sure. But we never did a product.

And then, in 2010, I knew we would get some money from... We would get $120,000 of money from the government. And my partner offered me to buy a share of the company for $10,000. So it was a no-brainer.

I said, yes, thank you very much. Got the money. Hired him. Which was a bit of a mistake. And at the time, like, he was really good at setting up servers and stuff. And, like, I couldn't be bothered to learn it.

So he stuck around with a big salary. Just to do the things I was scared to do, kind of. So I kept him on just because I was scared to do things. And it ended up bringing me down financially a lot.

At the time, I got some... When I got the money, I actually hired a bunch of people. Because I thought it would be a wheel that, like, okay, I can hire a bunch of people. Find some contracts and keep the good cash flow.

And then I'll get more financing from the government. It's just going to be a wheel that turns. But my computation was really bad. I didn't get new contracts.

So I had to let go a bunch of people. And that was painful. And I didn't get as much money as I thought from the government. So I just put myself in a bind financially.

And I'm still in it from that time. Like, I maintained the company going like a zombie. I had new clients. And I still did Ruby on Rails project.

And we did some really cool projects. Like, the transportation project is really nice. It's still working. Like, the company is making maybe 10 millions in profit. Maybe 5 millions in profit a year.

And it's all running on our software. And they want us to keep going and making it evolve as fast as possible. They have money. And we're migrating it now. It's still on Rails 2.3.

We're migrating it to Rails 8. It's almost done. I've done a bunch of it with AI. So I'm really happy with Cloud Code. I'm really happy. But it's crazy because...

Okay. I have to say that another thing happened is like in 2012. No, okay. There's... In 2009, actually, before I bought my partner back, I started another business with another guy in both transportation. Because I said, man, they don't have any software. We can build cool software for this industry.

And we did the directory of ports around the world with the resources for people. And I had did some software to serve people. But the guy wasn't using it. He wasn't testing it.

And I got tired of him not testing the software and not doing what he said he would do. So I kind of just dropped... Mentally dropped off. And the site kind of fizzled down and also went offline for a while. But we had big traffic.

And it still went offline because I was just not aggressive enough. I didn't believe in myself. And, yeah, I was selling myself short. Because I just had to push on the gas.

And he would have made some money for sure. And then, like, this fizzled out and ended up purchasing the code from me maybe around 2020 for like 3,000 or something. But it had fizzled out. And I don't know what's happening with the code.

It's shiporacle.com. So in 2012, my friend who has a surf school in Montreal was using WordPress. It sucked. So I decided that I would build a software for him. What I did is on the bus or on the train ride home, I designed the schema for the software.

We built it during a generation tool that was called Active Admin. And it was working great. Like, it started. I showed him. He was like, oh, yeah, cool. So I asked $6,000.

He said, cool. So we built it in maybe a week. Put it online. And it changed his life totally. Like, he started selling online. It worked really, really well.

So I was happy. He was happy. And then some other people in Quebec saw the software and thought, hey, that's cool. We want some. And we want one for lodging. So we built it.

Built it for lodging. And we won the contract. It was $20,000. But the goal was to make it, like, charge it at cost and build it so that it would gain some traction. And the second version with lodging, I actually, instead of doing the schema myself, I actually delegated it totally to Nikola, which was a good software programmer.

And I kind of a problem I've had since I started working with people. I always thought people were better than me. And people wanted to take responsibility. They would want to do the designing.

So I would delegate it. And this is a mistake I did. I told him to design the schema. And I didn't have the emotional fortitude to challenge him and make him do a good job in micromanaging.

Because in retrospect, I see that my strength is really doing database schema for automating processes and doing the modeling and stuff. And I should have modeled it instead of him because he did a bunch of mistakes. And I accepted his mistakes. So, yeah. So, yeah. So he did it.

And it worked. It worked well. But we're still paying a big price because the schema is not optimal. And just to give a comparison, like afterwards, like in 2014, we had a contract to build a software for an arborist company. And it was around $50,000. And it was like all the stuff.

It managed all their companies. It was pretty like from CRM to sending the quotes to a small ERP where they would manage their work orders, dispatch them, get the time input from the guy on the foreman. And then all the reports that came with it. And, yeah, this project was kind of stressful because I had to manage it and I had to make sure it was good.

So, what I did is I actually worked really hands-on with Nicola, the lead programmer on the project. And it was because I was more stressed that it would go off rails. And I did most of the schema, actually, and corrected him and made most of the design decisions.

And he did the tooling and the programming. And it was the perfect match. It was an amazing contract. We delivered on time.

The client was so happy. He sent us some flowers and stuff. He couldn't believe it. He totally changed his company.

And he still loves us to this day, even though we dropped the ball and we took two years to migrate instead of the four months we had promised. Because I was just too busy working on other things. He was okay with it. Because the software is doing so much.

So, yeah. So, I guess that's good. Like, both projects, right now when I'm talking about it and I see the contrast, I see how a project can go the right way and how it can go the wrong way. And if I'm hands-on and I kind of stress that it goes the wrong way, then I do a better job at micromanaging and I need to micromanage.

Or at least use my input, like my talent for abstraction and for schema design and architecting. So, I'm good at challenging the design decision and making sure we do the optimal thing so it doesn't go into a spiral, into some stupid useless feature that's going to take too much time to develop.

So, and afterwards, this kind of dynamic did happen on our software that we developed for the reservation. This software became, we called it Reservoir, it became the SaaS software. Now we have more than 100 clients. And the core big functionalities that were built, I actually built them when I was stressed because I had a new client.

And I promised it and I built them. And Nicolas, the lead programmer was like, "Oh, that's a cool feature." And he would just clean up the code and make it like fit into the, his code, the way he likes this code. So yeah, he's an INFP.

So he likes when things are, when he's comfortable in his work environment. But I don't mind. Like I like things to, I like to innovate to bring, to abstract things. And to bring new ideas.

So yeah. So I found I'm really good at innovating on the fly. Like I have fast ideas and I like to do some prototyping. And that's actually the best way I work with Nicolas. It's like, I don't have to tell him everything.

Sometimes I do the prototyping and it's like, "Oh, wow. That's really clean. That's really intelligent. That's really nice." But I don't like to do the cleaning the code and doing every day. Like making sure. Like I like that the naming is done right. I'm more into reusing stuff and doing a lot of dry stuff.

But that's important. And I'm good at refactoring and stuff. But when it gets too tedious and just like the spacing and it bores me. And he loves it. So we're a great team for that.

Like. And. I think sometimes he's not confident about his architecting and modeling. So he's going to propose something and I'm going to improve on his model and he's going to be happy. So he has a good model to work with. So he likes to kind of have like, if I give him a model that's already existing, a good analysis, then he likes to work with that.

And I have to give him a lot of feedback. But if we work like that, and if I'm rigorous about that, we're the best team. We're really good. So, but the problem is I always, it still happens to this day. I don't always drop projects.

Always. Like I talk to clients. I say, oh yeah, I'm going to do that. That's, I know how to fix it. And I want to fix it, but I get distracted.

And two weeks later, it's not fixed. And I haven't answered this email. And then I start to feel shame and I procrastinate and I feel like, and it sucks. And yeah, I started being like having dependency problems in 2017, actually.

But I always add like retrospectively when I look, I always had a big procrastination problem and big, like I would always wait for last minute and do the project in the night before meeting the client. And I would have a lot of sleepless nights and I would always be stressed.

Like since the beginning of the company, it was always like that. And I was always, I feel like I wasn't enough. And as soon as a client gave me feedback on something that he wasn't too happy, I would melt and feel like, like shit and almost cry. And I wanted to, like, I didn't want to live that.

And I felt ashamed. I felt like an imposter. And so, so that was kind of the dynamic. And to this day, I still, there's a, there's a bunch of clients that I have to get back to that were waiting on me.

I didn't. And it's kind of crazy because they pissed off at me because I ended up getting back at them. And then I have a good idea for a new feature that they haven't thought about. And then I add the feature and they're like, wow, that's too magical.

And, but they're going to say, we love that. We love that. Let's go. Why don't you like tell us more about the new feature? So they're always complaining, but taking with me because they love the software that we built, but the service sucks, but the service doesn't totally suck because I really listen to them.

And I really do features for them. And I really, it's like, I do miracles. Then I, I ghost them. Then I, and for me, it's crazy because it's bad because I have this shame that I keep with me.

And I always, as soon as somebody gives me some, some reproaches or critics that I take it personal and I feel like a total loser. And sometimes I have a good conversation with the client and they seem to, and I can take it personally too. I like, I feel they're my friends and they love me and they need to love me.

And that's, it's enough. It's an awful dynamic. And I'm more conscious of it now. And, but it led me to be depressed and, and, and procrastinate a lot.

So yeah, in 2017, like before I procrastinated on information, just reading too much information about everything and thinking everything was important, and trying new technologies all the time. And focusing on the business. Like I've never been good at focusing on the right thing. I was always, I used to think of new shiny object.

And then 2017, I started investing in Bitcoin and then fell into day trading with crypto. And I fell totally into that. So I was spending money and like, I spent so much time on that until, until 2000, I don't know, 2018 after the bear market, I stopped, but I was still listening to a bunch of YouTube videos.

And I fell totally into financial YouTube videos. And I thought I still wanted to day trade, but I wouldn't do it. And then I fell into music gear. And I was watching a bunch of music gear stuff.

So like, I wasn't productive. I wasn't doing like 20 hours of work for the company, like in average per year, like per week, actually. But, but like, I wasn't doing 20 hours per week, for years, you know. And, but then I would feel bad and work late at night.

I miss sleep. I still do that. No, actually I stopped doing it. But yeah, I'm a bit more disciplined now. and with the new software, actually, at first I was really into it and pushing it. But then what got to me was the onboarding process with the new clients.

Like I didn't have the patience. Like I like working with a good entrepreneurs that need the software, like for the transportation company. the RM dispatch. software that we did and the other arborist company the entrepreneurs they were really really they knew what they needed and they wanted to execute so they needed the software to execute so like they didn't need me to to give them training on the software they knew how to use it right away and they they would train their employees so we would only have to build it so that was amazing but with the sas software it's like every new client they didn't they sucked at managing and they they wanted to they're in the tourism industry and they wanted to do tourism stuff and they didn't want to manage so they were they were good entrepreneurs so they would take the software and always complain about features and always want more more training and it would kick me to the like i didn't want to do it because so i i would just ghost them and they're and they thought the software was amazing there was they were talking about it and there was some hype and people were onboarding but at the same time they were talking against our service because i didn't want to home onboard them so then in and and we weren't we didn't do anything for the like we use basic bootstrap css for the front end so it was okay it was responsive and all but it wasn't the best most shiny object like so in the 2020 some software company from quebec city they were 80 employees and they were really into the outdoors and they were really into the outdoors and they were really into the outdoors and they were really into the outdoors and they said hey why there's no good software for outdoors so they said we're gonna build it and they came into the market i thought i saw them coming and i said okay they're not gonna we have too much of a moat because we had built some pretty complex stuff that was really good and they ended up being so good at marketing at sales and at onboarding people and at service that they took since 2020 they onboarded 250 companies on their platform and we have only 100 we didn't like we grew like two three companies per year since that time and they took some clients from us but not a lot because we have a good software so yeah that's where we're at there it's not like right now the company is not owes a bunch of money to they owe a bunch we owe a bunch of money to the government i think i could sell the software but i really want to like the next phase of the next phase of the professional life i think i'm more confident about what i can do but i like i'm still procrastinating a lot and i'm still unfocused and falling into content online content like there's no way i can't stop looking at content so it's really hard but the next phase is but i still have a vision i have a vision for the company for the software like we have three really good software we have the tourism software that's really good i want to finish it right i want to finish it right and the way i want to finish it is like i want to i want to actually brainstorm all my ideas prioritize them with the aid of a of an ai agent have a plan make a plan and dispatch dispatch dispatch all the jobs so i can start making progress because i really have a good vision sure that this vision is going to work and and i believe in the power of of using ai agents because i know the domain i know the companies i know how to execute but i just don't do it because i'm kind of lazy and i don't like to manage people but it's always been a dream of mine to have an army of clones like a clone army that i could use to make my vision a reality and now i think it's we're entering this this air where it's it's possible so i'm really feeling empowered by this and i'm more confident and i got into my own like i read some stuff about self-esteem and and i'm really better at asserting myself and then and have more integrity and you know and i don't let people roll over me anymore and i know my word and like whatever this doesn't change my word sometimes it can be right about about our ghosting them and something i should be doing and that the service is not perfect but it's okay it's okay i accept it but i have a plan to fix it anyway so i welcome their and i agree with them actually and i welcome their their criticism of this part of the business
