Oh, there's another part to all this that's kind of a recurring theme in my professional life. And it's not going for it, having the idea, seeing the value of my idea, and then forgetting it. Like designing it, thinking about it, and then going to do something else and forgetting about it.

Not even forgetting, but just like doing something else, as if I have all the time in the world and time is infinite. So just like an example of that is when I started the Ruby on Rails company. I had noticed that my reflexes about the software development were pretty good.

And I had started going to conferences and asking questions to the experts. And I thought their answers were really unsatisfying. And I started telling them, do you know Ruby on Rails, blah, blah, blah. And it was . NET conferences. And they were like, yeah, but we're going to do the same thing in .

NET and blah, blah, blah. So I thought, okay, my reflexes are good. This is a better language. Ruby is a better language.

The architecture is better. The architecture is better. And if they're saying they just want to stay with . NET instead of using the best tool, then it's them.

They have a problem. And at that time, there's also like I was really into personal like self-help and stuff. And like I wonder like how can the Coldplay guy write his songs? And I thought like it was 2005, 2004.

And I thought like I should start a podcast. And maybe I like interview those guys. But it was in 2004. And we're in 2025.

And now the podcast is the big thing 20 years later. But if I had started the podcast, it'd be so big today. If I had started like marketing, it'd be so big today. So many things. It's like I saw the internet wave coming.

I had all the ideas. And then I did nothing. I didn't execute. But I knew it was happening. The same thing with Bitcoin.

I was like Bitcoin is the big thing. And it was every time it crashed. I said I should buy. I should buy. I should buy. But I was too scared.

I didn't do it. And so, yeah, there is some self-assertion into that. There is some self-confidence and some like about internet. There's also the point of like if I fail in public, then people are going to see me.

But now it's what I actually want to do. Like no matter what, I want to do it. I really want to do it. Yeah, something happened with apps.

When apps, iPhone apps started, I could have built apps. And I didn't. Okay, that was the prologue of all this professional thing. I want to make sure it's understood that even if I see trends coming, if I know how to innovate and have really good idea, I often build those ideas in my head and leave them there.

And I really think AI can help me change this synthetic imagination cloud coming up. It's going to be so much tough that whatever I do is like, if it's good, it's going to go to the surface. And I have to stop worrying. Like what stops me?

It's only like the worry that what people thought about me. And another thing also, I stopped talking about acting. But one of my plans when I started working in a bar was to work in a bar, live alone in my apartment and write songs. Because I had a crazy, I was really creative.

I had a lot of song ideas. And I wanted to draw. I want to practice drawing. But it's kind of, I started doing it.

But then I would feel like FOMO of not seeing my friends. And I would fear being rejected. So I would kind of be depressed. So instead of working on my stuff, I would just look at content online.

It's insane. And at that time, I had like no TV. I didn't want a TV. I didn't want to watch TV. I didn't want to watch content.

But then the internet was there. And I kind of became addicted to the internet instead of creating and improving my skills at writing songs, singing, and drawing. And at the same time, I got into a... there's another thing. I also started surfing in Montreal.

And when I started surfing, I got into really addicted to that. So I think that took too much of my attention and too much of my time. I was kind of all over the place. Yeah. So I was dropping a bunch of balls.

Yeah. And didn't... Wasn't focusing on the plan I had for myself. I had started also doing some acting classes. And the girl at the acting classes, she said, wow, this guy is so beautiful. So I guess I had a chance.

I guess... I know I had a chance. Because afterwards, I did some other acting stuff. Like my kids were in the improvisation. And there was a night with the parent.

And I went there. And like people... A girl told me, you should change your career and be an actor. And it's like what I always thought. Is it too late?

Can I still do it? I still want to do it. A bit lost. And found at the same time. And I have to say, I love to self-diagnose me.

And I analyze myself to see like, what's my problem? Because I see I'm kind of different. And the things that helped me the most is first, the ADHD test helped me. Some kind of helped, but at the same time, I took pills and it didn't really help me.

And then there's the MBTI profiles, like 16 personalities. This helped me a lot. I was like... And then I... Because it helped me so much, actually. I fell deep in it.

And I studied everything about it. And the cognitive functions and how it works. And this helped me the most. And then the other thing is I saw somebody talking about the Puerheteranus, something from Carl Jung.

The archetype Puerheteranus. And I was like, okay. Okay, that's me. That's totally me. So the hero that just doesn't grow to become a hero. So... And there's always those possibilities because I never do anything. So I never fail.

It's always the possibilities. So this helped me grow, actually, and make more decisions because I see the pattern. And like the... Being... Knowing that I'm an INTP helped me a lot to, yeah, understand the way I think and my interaction with other people. Yeah.
