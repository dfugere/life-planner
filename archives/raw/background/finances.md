Okay, so I'll tell you about my history of a bad relationship with money. I don't, from when I was young, I don't really remember. I just remember like one incident when I was maybe eight years old. I was in a store with a friend and we broke like some decoration that fell to the floor.

And it was actually a Portuguese rooster culture. And my friend's parent paid for him and they paid for both of us. But they asked me to give them the money for the one I broke. So that's what I did.

I went to my bank and I went to give them money and I gave it to them. And I didn't tell my parents actually. I didn't tell anyone. I remember from when I was young, I wouldn't ask a lot of things to my parents.

I guess I felt alone. I don't know. I felt I was by myself and they wouldn't help me. Because I don't remember asking them much. I remember one time I was in a store with my mom.

We were shopping for something. I don't remember what. Maybe gifts for Christmas or I don't know what. And she said, hey, do you want a toy?

Just choose a toy that you want. And I just said, no, I'm okay. I don't know why. I look at the toys.

Some toys look really cool. But I didn't choose any toy. I just said, no, no, it's okay. Strange. Like, thinking back, I was like, I could have had any toy.

Why did I get it? And then, yeah, I remember about toys. I remember one day my mom wanted to buy us toys. But she finally just bought one for her godchild.

Because my dad told her not to buy it for them. For us. Because we had the... Because the toys she wanted to buy had batteries. My dad said, no, no, they always lose their batteries.

And lose stuff with their batteries. So don't buy it. So, yeah, that was kind of shit. But anyways, that's not about finances.

So I'll keep going thinking of, like, my finances. First time we spent money. We had some gifts. I was really young.

I bought some. I bought some. I bought a few things. Like, how do you call it? A pocket. Like, yeah, some puppets. And puppets. I bought. And I don't remember.

But my twin brother and I had the same amount. I think I stole a bit from him. But I'm not sure. Did I steal a bit from him?

Or did he steal a bit from me? The story is blurred. I don't really remember. But I remember the first time we went to the store and spent money.

It was to buy toys. I was really happy with those toys. I kept them for a long time. I think they're still in my childhood bedroom.

And afterwards, what I remember is, yeah, my mother used to give us maybe $2 a week or something. Maybe less. She would give us like some $0.35 when we would go do some errands for her. And when I started hanging out with, like in fifth grade of primary school, in fifth grade, started hanging out with richer kids, Alexal and Jean-Philippe.

And they were like, yeah, they earned everything they wanted. It was crazy. They always bought a bunch of things. We kind of couldn't keep up. That's another thing I could remember.

And then around 14 years old, I got a first real job. Washing dishes near my house in a restaurant. And then I worked there for one summer. The summer after, I wasn't sure.

So the chef, the owner fired me because he said, are you working this summer? And I said, wait, I don't know. He said, no, you're not working. Just like that. I wasn't sure. And then, yeah, that's it for now.

So at that age, I was around 14 years old, I guess. I was, at that time, I was around 14 years old. And then I didn't work for the school year, for sure. And the summer after, yeah, I don't really remember if it was third grade, third ninth grade.

So like in Quebec, it's actually second half, so it's high school, secondary school. So secondary school starts at the first grade of secondary school. It's actually like seventh grade. So, yeah, I was around, I think I was 14 when I started working there.

I'm not sure when it was. And the day after I worked, I had, because I had left that job, or he fired me. So I worked for a young entrepreneur. He did some student paintings to paint houses.

So I did that for one summer. And then they didn't have a job. Maybe I think I did some odd jobs for my mother, because my mother had a clothing store. So I would do some odd jobs for her.

Like I would do some modeling in the street. She would walk around in the street in the city of St. Agathe on Friday and Saturday evening, and go in the restaurant and give the business card to customers. And people would come see us, see the boutique to buy clothes at her store.

Yeah, that's about what I remember. Like around 16 years old, 8, 17 years old. I think I started doing some painting contracts. Like I did it at my house, like my parents' house.

And for some neighbors, I did some painting contracts. So I made some money, but I really didn't have a lot of money. So I remember going to parties and bars, and it was always hard to get some cash to drink. And I didn't have much stuff, didn't have a car or anything.

And my friends worked. From what I remember, my friends worked more than me. I don't remember working that much. Then I went one year at 18 years old.

I was 17 when I left. And I left after high school. I did one session at CJET. And I left in January of 96 to go one year in an exchange program to go in Costa Rica.

It didn't work that year. And I spent a bunch of money on the credit card, actually. So when I came back, I had debt. It wasn't too good.

And I remember some friends I had that went to the same kind of program had paid themselves for the program. But I didn't. My parents paid for the program. Just my parents paid for the program. So I went there with my parents' money.

And when I came back, I had debt. So when I came back, I was 18 years old. I got a job at... I actually went to school.

So I was living with my father in Montreal. I was in CJET, which is kind of... Because in Quebec, we have in between high school and university, there's two years in CJET. So, yeah. So I went to...

Was I working when I was there? Yeah, I think I was working as a camp counselor for the first year. And the second year, I was working as a boat captain for the local boat ferry. Not ferry, but there was a touristic boat tour on the lake in Cére-Captain-Mont.

So I was a captain there. I made... No, at that time, I was making better money. But, like, I didn't have a budget. I wasn't, like, responsible with my money.

I wasn't investing. I wasn't... I just remember at one point, my mother told me, Hey, you should buy some... I had a little extra money, and she said, Oh, you should buy some bonds, and you're going to get better interest. And, yeah, my father wouldn't talk about money at all, even though he's a financial...

By the time, he was a financial planner. Like, at one point, he told us about compound interest and how I could be a millionaire by 40 years old if I just put 2,000 a year in investment. But I didn't know how I would get the 2,000 a year, so, yeah.

I've been more stressful than anything to me in that year. But he was talking about... It wasn't about... It wasn't... I wasn't feeling... Yeah, it was more stressful because I didn't know how to get the money to invest. They didn't do anything about it.

And then, during Egypt, I worked as a captain during university. I actually went to computer science. I was at computer science university, so I worked as a... We had a co-op, that you call a co-op program.

And this program, you get... You get... You say... Internships. Paid internships. So I was making better money. It was a little over minimum wage. So, yeah, I was making better money.

And I was working as a computer programmer. From then on... How old age was I? I was around 21. Yeah, I worked two summer...

Full summer as a captain. At 19... And... 20... I think at 21, I started working as a computer programmer. I kind of liked it. I liked some part of it.

Yeah. And how about money? I don't remember how... I was wasting my money. I was just spending...

Maybe I had a bit... Economies, but... Not that much. I was spending most of it. And then... Didn't I have a financial plan or anything? But I remember... Not having a lot of money.

I was... Yeah, I remember when I went to bars. I didn't have cash to... To buy... My alcohol. I had no notion of investing at all. That was... Around... 1999... 1999... 2000... Yeah, my parents paid for...

School fees... And the apartment... When I was living in... Chambrook... And I paid for my... I paid for my... And I was eating...

Pretty much... All the... Like the same thing all the time. The elaborate food... Chicken and pasta... Then... Like all through university... I did some... Internships. Then when I finished university... I was pretty stressed...

Because I didn't have confidence... About getting a job. And... I think it was... After the dot com...

So... Like... It wasn't that great. And... And... I got a job... As a... As a programmer... In the... Transportation company... And... Did really low salary... Like... I was paid... Payed $35,000 a year...

And... Then... Got bored after... A year... Maybe... A little bit more... And... Went to work... In the bar... As a bar boy... Was making a bit more money... But not that much...

And I left... I left my parents... Like... I was living with my father... And I... I left... Because... I didn't like the... The... I didn't like the...

Anyways... I left... To work... To live by myself... In an apartment... That cost me... 600 bucks... A month... And it was a lot of money for me... And... By that time... I had bought a...

Car also... Oof... That was hard... The financial... Because... I had left my... My job... At the transportation company... As a programmer... I went... To... Start working... Yeah... What I wanted to do... Was to start working on my own...

Do some money from the internet... But... Yeah... Just... It's painful... Just to think about it... Because... I didn't have money... And... Like... I wouldn't sell... I wouldn't... Like... At that time... I... I didn't make... At all... A lot of money...

At all... And... Because I had... Been fired from the... From the... The bar I was working at... At the end of summer... And... Started... I was on... How do you call it...

Assurance chômage... We call it in... Quebec... So it's... .. .. .. .. Unemployment insurance... So I was on... Unemployment insurance... And I started doing... Odd jobs... .. .. .. Contracts... And on this... Unemployment insurance... I actually... .. Got... .. .. I call it... .. A subsidy... From the government... For... People that were on...

Unemployment... Insurance... That wanted to start their own business... That was in... .. 2003... So I was... 25 years old... So yeah... I started my own business... I wasn't doing any sales...

So... .. .. Not much happening... And I got a contract... Oh... That was bad... So bad... I got a contract... .. And the contract didn't go well... Like... I was paying like...

Four... Ten thousand dollars... For the contract... And like... It was a really hard... Software development contract... That didn't go well... So... And I... I was trying to make it go well... So I was working really hard...

I think I worked like... A year on... Ten thousand dollars... I got ten thousand dollars... And then I... I started to get paid like... Fifty dollars an hour...

For my work... But... It wasn't... Going anywhere... So I... What happened... I... .. Yeah... At that time I had no money... I... I was on... Still on the... I had no money... And no financial plan... I was... I wasn't even budgeting...

It was crazy... I had... And I had a bunch... Because I was worth... Like... Living by myself... Six hundred dollars... A month... Which at the time was more money... It's Canadian money... Of course... And... .. I had the car payment... And... .. I... I got... A lot of... .. Of... Car... ..

Violation ticket... Because of parking... Violation ticket... I had to pay that off... But... I didn't have money... So... .. Instead of going to jail... Like... They found... .. The government had a program...

Where I... I could work... Minimum wage... For... Some... .. Charity... And... .. That's... Like... The money... The money from this... Would pay for the... For the... For the ticket... And I had... A few thousand dollars... Of tickets to pay...

Oh yeah... That's bad... And... Just thinking about it... It's been... A bit busy... And... .. At that time... I had started accumulating... Credit card debt... And at one point... My parents said... Hey... We want to help you...

And they paid my credit card debt... I had two thousand dollars... At the time... It was pretty big... And they did the same thing...

For my brother... My brother... Yeah... Finally left... To go to... British Columbia... And... .. .. By now... Age 26... I think I was on the same contract... I actually... .. I was doing some programming at home... But like... Not clients... Because I wasn't solicitating clients... So... I wasn't doing much... Actually...

It wasn't... I had no money... And then... I thought about... About going back in the bar... But... .. I ended up... Working with... .. Partnering with... Some... .. .. A guy I met... .. Through my brothers... And... .. Other friends... .. That was... .. Really good programmer... And really... .. Great... .. Manager... Actually... So we... We got a...

Actually a contract together... To build a software... For a... A transportation company... Actually... Which was... .. Two of the guys I was working with... At the other transportation company...

That had started their... Their own company... So they hired us... We built the software... And me and... The other guy... Which his name is Benjamin...

We started our company... And... .. That was in... .. 2006... In fact... Started our company... And... Of course... It wasn't doing well... .. Because we weren't selling... .. We were... We were reselling... Like... I was... .. Over... .. I'd say... Idealistic... And... .. I wanted to... Build good software... And... I would... Judge myself... And I would...

I wouldn't build the client... And I would... Oh... And so... Yeah... So... .. I would work... Way more hours... And correct every little... Imperfection of the software... And not build the client for it... ..

But the client had money... And they could pay... But... .. We just... We wouldn't build that... We'd take a lot of write-offs...

And... .. We would do some... Networking... And... Get some more... Jobs... Here and there... But... .. It wasn't really going well... And then... We got a... Somewhat bigger... Contract... And... .. We hired... It was big enough... We hired two employees...

But... .. Yeah... It wasn't really that big enough... But... .. I guess it was just big enough... To have two employees... And we were... .. But yeah... We... We always... We always had some...

Cash flow problems... And then I took... .. As part of the company... And the company made a deal... And I took a job...

Full time... And then I made a lot of money... I made like... .. For the time was... A lot of money... It was around... A hundred thousand dollars... A year... Comparison... So I was... Making more money... It was fun... .. That was... Really small time... It took... Like... I worked there...

It's at... Tribal Nova... I worked there for... .. For... Six months... Then... .. Six months... And came back to... My... To the company... And it started... Being... Bad again... Then... I had my kids... Then we had... .. We had bigger contracts... And we had... .. A credit... Tax credit... For... Research and development...

So we had like... Hundred and twenty thousand dollars... So I could pay myself... A lot more... And I bought... Company back... From my partner... So I had a bunch of money...

So that was a good time... We went traveling... Me and my... .. Family... .. Girlfriend... With... .. With my kids... And... .. When they were six months... We went for a month... And when they were...

Yeah... For a month... We went... .. To California... And... .. I had way more money... And... .. At the same time... My girlfriend... Who is a lawyer... .. Tax lawyer... She was... She has a master's...

In... Tax law... And... .. She had... .. Lost her job... Because she was pregnant... Actually... Your boss said... Okay... I can... I can pay you... And... .. She had lost her job... So she was on... ..

Not welfare... But... .. Employment insurance... And... .. Yeah... It wasn't... .. The Klondike... As we say... It wasn't a lot of money... We didn't make a lot of money... And... It's always been... Pretty much the same... Since... Actually... No... It's like... From that time... From when I had... .. 120,000 dollars... I started...

Making sure I was always... Paid a salary... And... .. We had... Bigger contracts... So I could pay myself salary... We had some more... Cash in the bank...

But then... I made some really... Really poor financial decisions... I decided to hire more people... To get more... Tax credit... But I did... I did that... Too fast... And I wasn't a good manager...

So... .. People weren't working on the right thing... And it wasn't making money... The company wasn't making money... So... I kind of wasted that money...

On new hires... And... .. It came back to the same situation... .. Almost... I can say like financially... It was the same since then... And it's always... It's only been worse...

Because... But actually at that time... Like when we had the kids... And when... .. We moved... That's what... That was in 2009... I started making... A bit more money...

Then... I went to the bank... And... And... .. I did... Start investing... Putting money in... In funds... And... .. Just a little bit... And... And I was watching the investment... Mutual funds... And... .. At that time... .. I was... .. Optimistic for the future...

Like it's one of the only times... I was optimistic... Really... In terms of money... Because it... After... But afterwards... Was always like... I... Either I have a big contract... I make money... And then... Comes down... And around... .. Actually in 2017... I... Was watch... I... I heard about Bitcoin...

I actually heard about Bitcoin... Before that... But... .. I thought it was the same thing... As... .. Other... .. Digital... .. Cryptocurrency... That... That existed before... And I didn't believe it could... It could keep going...

So... I didn't... Take notice... And then in 2017... When... It was around... 1,000 US... I read... The white paper... And I got... Totally hooked... I said... Okay... This is insane... This... This is gonna change the world... And... .. I decided to buy some... And it was at the beginning of the bull market...

So... It really... Really... Like... Rises up... Rised up fast... But then dropped really fast too... So it was scary... But I bought some more... And more... And more... And... And my investment... Kind of... Became bigger... And... But then I... I looked at other crypto...

And I saw how fast they were going... And I wasn't really... Like... Thinking things out... I was just... Totally caught in the hype... And I started... Literally gambling... And... But it was the bull market...

For crypto... So I was making... A bunch of money... And then... When the bear market... And I was... Wasting my time... Not working... On my company anymore...

Or... Really... Not... Not enough... And... .. Then... What happened... .. Then the bull market... The bear market came... And I... Lost pretty much everything... I reinvested a bunch...

And I lost some more... So that's when I started... Getting in debt... Before that... I didn't have... Credit card debt... But I got into... Credit card debt... To buy a bit...

More Bitcoin... Because I didn't have... The cash on end... And at first... It was a good move... Because... I could... Resell some... And... And pay my credit card...

And then... Keep some Bitcoin... And that would... I would just make money... So that... That would really work... But then... When the bull... Then the... Bear market arrived... I... .. I still did that... That same... Scheme... And... .. Just... Embedded myself... A lot... So... .. That was in... 2017... And... I haven't...

Actually crawled back... From that... And I also... I used to... Like... This was pretty bad... Because I used to also... .. Pay... Taxes... And have an accountant... And pay what I was due...

Like... With my company... And then... .. Yeah... I started really... Letting things go... Because I had... I didn't have much time... Because I was addicted to... .. Looking at the stock taker online... Actually... And not making good moves...

And wasting money... So... .. So at the same time... I started getting in debt... To the government... Because I wouldn't... Do my reports... I wouldn't pay taxes... So I accumulated... Personal... Debt... And... Business debt... And... Since that time... It's the same pattern...

That repeated... .. Since then I stopped... .. I... No... Actually I did... Gamble some more... Because at one time... .. In 2020... I said... I told my... .. Girlfriend... .. You really have to buy Bitcoin... It's gonna go to the moon...

And... It's the future of money... And she said... Okay... I'll give you my money... I have all... On the side... And put it in Bitcoin... And I didn't put it in Bitcoin...

I put it in a... Stupid... Company... That had some Bitcoin... On... On its balance sheet... And... .. It was a scam...

And I lost... Actually... .. And I made some really bad moves... And I lost... .. I almost lost all the money... Like $60,000... So that was... Personally... Extremely bad... Like... Since then... We haven't seen the same couple... Because I feel ashamed...

And... .. And she cried a bunch... And she trusted me... And I did all the worst moves... And at the same time...

I actually had... Some... At $13,000... In another... Account... But... I couldn't... Really touch it... Because in the account... It cost a lot of money... To trade... Every time I would do a trade... It would cost me $100...

So I bought... Some MicroStrategy... And some Bitcoin... And it ended up going... Like now... It's at... Maybe around $30,000... Or it doubled... But... That was my plan... With my girlfriend's money... But... I don't know why...

I couldn't... Act in the way I had planned... I just did some stupid things... On the... And... I didn't... I knew I had to invest... In Bitcoin... And MicroStrategy... But that's not what I did...

And... I'm still... I'm still so ashamed... And so pissed off at myself... At what I did... And at that time...

I was looking at MicroStrategy... And said... I would be so happy... If it would come down... So I could buy it again...

And then it did come down... There was a bear market... And it was really low... And I said... I have to put all the money in it...

And I would have made like... More than $100,000... But I just didn't do the move... I was too... I feel like an idiot... I did all the wrong moves...

Like... Then when it went up... I actually... Put all the money... Into a... Levered GTF... On my MicroStrategy... At the height of it... And it came down...

So... Everything was lost... It's disgusting... I feel disgusted... I almost wanted to kill myself... I feel disgusted... So... Yeah... And then... There's a... So the situation has got... Has just gotten worse and worse... Since... Since the time I started getting into debt...

To buy some Bitcoin... Because I didn't hold on to it... I... And now... Now we live in a... Two bedroom apartment... In Montreal... On Coolbrook Avenue... Our... It is... $1,700... Which is... Pretty good for that kind of apartment...

Because we have a... A garage... Which is... A basement... It's well isolated... So we can use it as a basement... It's not... We couldn't... Like... I put some... Gym... Flooring... Like some... Gym mattresses... As flooring... And... It's okay to... Go practice music... And... My teens... They do parties there...

And they have kind of their... Lounge... With baby foot tables... So it does the job... And we have a dog...

And a cat... So... The... The owner... Allows us to keep... Our animals... And we... Right now... We wouldn't have the... Funds to buy... A home... I actually... Bought a home... With my... Brother... In 2007... We bought a duplex... In... Verdun... And... We bought it for... Two... Hundred and thirty...

Six... Thousand dollars... At the time... Today... If I wanted to buy it back... It would be around... A million... So... Sixteen years... Later... And... Yeah... I wasn't responsible... I wasn't looking at the... But the worst is...

When I... Sometimes I... I just thought about... What I could do for money... And I thought... The best business to have... Would be to own some...

Some duplexes... And rent the apartment... It's already... Always rented... And it pays for itself... And... I didn't do it... I was just like...

In my head too much... And didn't take action... As... Always... Pretty much... So... I don't... Really own anything... Except... I'm... Hundred percent... Owner of my company... And... My... Personal assets are... I got... Maybe... Ten thousand dollars... Of... Music equipment... And... Stuff like that... I could sell... If I had to liquidate it...

And... .. That's another part... That I forgot... Like... Right before the COVID... I... I needed to repair a guitar... I went to the Luthier... And... It was too expensive...

So I looked online... On Marketplace... And found... On Kijiji... Some really cheap guitars... That were really good... So I decided to...

Buy them... And resell them... And I started... Doing that... And I... I got it... To... Into it... Pretty deeply... And... Since then... I bought and sold... Like... 400 guitars... Maybe... Like... More than... 500 items... Like... Including... .. Other musical instruments... And... .. I made... Since... Those... Six years... I made...

Fifty thousand dollars... In profit... Like... Under the table... .. At one point... I... My business was going so bad... That... .. I was using this... To make a living... Actually... And... .. But... I've stopped since... .. Maybe... Six months... Yeah... I haven't done it...

For like... Six months... And... .. I don't want to do it again... Because... .. I can make a lot more money... From my business... Like... Right now... .. Every new client... Pays me... A thousand dollars... And... It's... .. Two hours of work... Max... So... So... And I have other clients... That... They want me...

They want me to work for them for... It's more than... A hundred and fifty dollars an hour... So I could be doing well... If I was just more focused...

And... And if I did some... .. More organized... And... Yeah... If I... If I just... Worked better... So... It doesn't really... It's not worth it to... Flip things on marketplace... But... .. I did it for a while...

Five years... I lost a bunch of time... I could... Actually... Because I would have made more money on... .. In my business... If I had worked... That's an opportunity to do more money...

Just... Focus on my business... And... Yeah... I have maybe... In terms of assets... I have... Like... I could sell... Maybe for $10,000... Of stuff... That I own... And that's pretty much it... I have... .. $30,000... Maybe less now... Because the market is crashing...

In investment... I owe... .. Personally... I have a credit card debt... For $12,000... To Visa... I have... .. $7,000 debt... To CIBC... Credit cards... I have... $20,000... .. Debt... To... RBC... It's a loan... .. It's a credit margin... And... .. Yeah... So... All in all... It's... $40,000... Of debt... So... That's pretty much... ..

My investments... Also... And if I look at my company... My company owes... .. $52,000... To the provincial government... For... Taxes... .. .. At least... As much... To the... Federal government... We have a $60,000... .. Loan... From the bank... And a credit card...

For... $17,000... I think that's it... I have to look at my... Assets... In terms of... .. Receivables... But I have more than... $40,000... In receivables... And the software... That we have... We've been... Offered... At least... .. Annual revenue... Of the software... To buy it out...

So I guess I could... Sell it for... Twice as much... As... The annual revenue... Easily... So that's... That's... .. That would be... $400,000... I think I'd do that... I guess with my software... The situation... Is not as dire... But I... Really have to... Lean into it... And... Like... Make it...

Worth more... And I think it's... It's... .. It's not complex... It's simple... But... It's work... So I just have to... Focus... And I think with AI... I can get there...

It's just... .. Automating... All the... Onboarding... Invoicing... .. Support... And... Scaling it... Because the software... Is really good... So... It's not as dire... And I would really... Like what I would want... Is to have... Because right now... We have... $200,000 a year...

From our clients... If I would just double... The client base... To 200 clients... I could have... .. $400,000 a year... I... I think I could do it... With the same team...

We're only two... With more use... Better use of AI... I think we could... We could do it... And... .. We'd be profitable... And if we can...

Double it again... Then we'd be... $800,000... And if we... Raise our prices a bit... Then we could be... At a million a year... That's where I want to be...

I'm sure we can be there... I think we could be there... Within two years...
