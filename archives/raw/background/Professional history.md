Okay, so now I want to talk more about my professional life. Like what were my talents when I was younger, what I wanted to do and what I've been doing with my life. When I was young, I don't know if I should talk about my professional life or my life in general.

I think I'll try to speak about my life in general, including friends. Yeah, including my life in general and I'll see if I need to do a specific description. Actually, I'll focus on my professional life and I will do the general life at another point. So when I was young, I remember clearly I wanted to...

I'm pretty young. I wanted to be an artist. I wanted to be a singer and actor, for sure. But maybe our kids want to do that, but that's really, really, really what I wanted to do. I asked my mother to have a piano and she told me no.

And then I re-asked and re-asked. And she told me, I want you to do some piano classes and if you like it, then we'll buy a piano. But that's not what I wanted. Because I saw a lot of people do piano classes and it looked like it sucked.

Like they were learning some solfege and some really classical stuff and it sucked. It just looked like it sucked. And what I wanted to do was learn to play piano music, like understand music and play piano, but without the rigidity of it. So we never had the piano, never did.

And I wanted to play guitar too, but yeah, there was something about my house. My mom was working a lot. My father was working a lot. We had a nanny at home, me and my twin brother.

And I guess I was just not asking for a lot to my parents. I don't know why. I was just not asking for things I wanted. Maybe it's because when I asked, like the piano, my mother would turn around and try to convince me of another way to go.

And it's not what I wanted. But she tried to convince me of something. My mother is like that. And I understood it way too late.

I understood it like a few years ago, actually, that when you ask her something, she kind of doesn't really listen. And she tries to, she says she understands and everything. She actually tries to convince you of something else, of her own ideas of things. And for no good reason, because it doesn't necessarily make her any good.

She just likes to convince people of stuff. So, yeah. And I remember, yeah, I wanted to be a singer. And I remember, and I was really good at drawing. From really young, I loved drawing.

And also, I remember, like, in the second grade, maybe first or second grade, I'm not sure. I wrote a poem. And I thought it was, like, by far the best poem of the class. It was really good.

And even the teacher, like, read it to everyone. And I was pretty proud. And I was like, I love doing that. And I'm good at that.

And I wanted to do it more. And I gave the poem. The poem was for the, for Father's Day. And I gave it to my father.

And he didn't make a fuss of it. Like, he didn't seem to care. He didn't seem to like it. I was like, it's so fucking good.

My head. Like, this is so fucking good. What the fuck's your problem? You don't like my poem. My poem is so fucking good.

And you didn't tell me, hey, this is so fucking good. You just said, oh, you did a poem, Yellow Boy. Oh, that's cute. And yeah, I have, so I remember that. It wasn't a good experience.

And I remember drawing a lot, being really good at drawing. And my mother told me, oh, your drawings are amazing. My father didn't care. And he used to show him my drawings.

And he didn't care. Nobody cared about my drawings. And I love to draw. So when I got into high school, first grade of high school, like for the United States, it's like seventh grade.

Because I'm in Quebec. Then I went to first year in seventh grade. I went to a private high school that was really like the best high school in the province of Quebec. And I got into like, I got a really good entry test.

And I got into the best class, actually, enriched, best class of the best high school in Quebec. And then, like, I was really, really, I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't do my homework, like ever. I couldn't. It was impossible. I was like looking all around, couldn't concentrate doing my homework.

In school, in class, I was really good. I remembered everything. I was really good in class. I understood really fast. Like when there were people around and everything.

But I couldn't concentrate by myself and focus on doing homework. Like, it was really hard. And unless, like, it was the day before the exam that I could study what I had to study and I had good grades. And, like, sometimes, like, some homework I could.

No, but it was really hard to do homework. And the worst is, I remember I kind of liked it when I did it. When I did the homework, I kind of liked it. But, yeah, I had problem focusing.

And one of those examples is in second grade. We had a big homework to do. It's like, it was all year, I think. It was a book of workbooks of math exercises, arithmetic exercises.

And, like, it wasn't hard for me, but they were too much. And I couldn't concentrate and do it by myself. So, I would just not do it. I couldn't. Like, I was second grade already procrastinating.

And at one point, I just, because I knew I had to give it the day. Like, at one point, there was a day I had to give the book to the teacher. Like, it was due. And it wasn't done.

I hadn't done anything and I couldn't do it. I wasn't able to concentrate and to do it. So, what I did is I tore the book up, the workbook up, and I put it in the papers where we have fire paper. And I put it at the top because I wanted, I kind of wanted my mom to see it.

And then she saw it and she says, oh, what's that? Why do you have your workbook in the fire paper? And I said, I don't know what happened. You know, I was lying, saying I didn't know.

And then she believed me. I was like, this worked. And then I think she could talk to the teacher. And then I had to do the freaking work.

One day of activities where everybody was having fun in school and they have to stay in the class and do the freaking workbook. So, I did it. And I had a good grade because it was easy. But, oh, man, at the same time, it was so hard.

But the hard thing wasn't the exercises weren't hard, I remember. It was just the tediousness of it that I couldn't bear it. So, yeah, that's one example of two changes. One, procrastination from really a young age.

Two, impossibility to focus on long homework. And three, I started lying to get out of things and bullshitting people and seeing that it worked and I didn't get into trouble when I did that. So, that's like things I remember from doing my homework. For the rest, yeah, I remember I wasn't studying to do the multiplication tables.

So, when we got in class, I was often like really aloof and I wasn't the best at multiplication tables. Because I didn't care. It was either I was really, really, really good at things or I didn't care. And then I didn't have bad grades because at the time that it counted, I would review what I had to review and I would have good grades.

So, yeah, that's why at the end, I ended up getting into the best high school and private high school in Quebec. So, because I don't remember like my elementary school at all or not that much like the income. I remember doing a really good drawing in sixth grade.

And I was like, this is an amazing drawing. Like nobody did anything like that. And it wasn't, oh, and I remember this. And I remember we had to do observation drawing.

I had to do a converse shoe. And I was like, I did this converse shoe and it was so good. And it was really good. Like my teacher told me.

And I thought I was really good. I thought I was the best actually. And I think I was. And I remember coming home one day and I was in fifth grade, fourth grade.

And I did observation drawings at home. And my mom was like, she put it on the wall in her store because she had a closing store. And I was really proud. Like I did the Disney figurines or Muppets that I drew.

And she was like, this is so amazing. You came on and you did it by yourself. And she was proud. And the thing is, my father wasn't there.

And he was never proud of those. And it did something. It really did. It was something strange. I don't know. I can't. I felt, yeah, I felt unseen for sure.

With all my talents, I was unseen. And so when I got into high school, the problem is I got into the best high school in Quebec. But I had, yeah, I was a teen. And I had started hanging around a group of friends that it was kind of not a bit toxic.

And there was a lot of FOMO. And I wanted to be with them. So because I felt like if I wasn't there, it was really FOMO. I felt like if I wasn't there, they would be talking against me and I would lose my friends.

So I really wanted to be with them in high school, in the public high school. Instead, I got them all. I didn't want to be at the private high school in Montreal. I went to Brebeuf, Jean-Den-Brebeuf.

And we would sleep there. So I was trying to get kicked out. But not by having bad grades, but just by doing stupid things. So I had a really, really good year.

I did a lot of stupid things. And it was fun. And it was actually the best year of schooling of my life. Because the actual curriculum, like what I was learning, was actually really interesting.

I actually loved it, even though I was getting into trouble. But I loved it. And for some reason, the dean was really nice with me. I guess I don't know why.

It was really nice. And I really messed up. Like I should have stayed there. This was meant for me way more than public high school.

I really should have stayed there. Because I was the best in art class. The teacher said I had the crazy talent. And I did think I was better than the kids.

I did think I had a crazy talent. Because when I started drawing, like I did a self-portrait. And it was like a picture. And I didn't have a lot of experience drawing that much.

But I did a self-portrait that was like a picture. And I was impressed by myself. I remember my mother was surprised. But I remember my father was like, they didn't say anything.

And that's another thing. Like I remember I, my father wouldn't say much. Like we were in Montreal. And he hadn't been there at all.

Our youth, because he was always in Montreal. Now we were in Montreal. And we weren't even living with him. We were living at the high school.

Maybe, okay, he had some problem with his work. And he couldn't. But he didn't even take time to come spend time with us. Like maybe once a week, we would have dinner together at a restaurant. And that's it. Kind of sucks. Fucking sucks. I'm getting pissed now just thinking about it.

Man. And like I would get into trouble and have some detention. And sometimes the detention would be on Friday night. On Friday after school. And he would get so pissed at me because of detention.

And like he wouldn't ask me about how things were going. He would just be pissed at me because I was on detention. So he would be really good to criticize me and never good to tell me how good I was. Fucking asshole. I'm really getting pissed just thinking about it.

Fucking loser. 47 years old and I kissed at my dad. So yeah. And I remember when I was at this high school. At one time I did some improvisation just to try it. Like the improvisation team came and showed us how to do improvisation.

And it was so much fun. Like I loved it. I was really, really, really good. I made everybody laugh.

But afterwards I didn't know where to do improvisation. And I didn't try to get in the team. But I should have. And I guess I was.

I didn't have. And I remember at that time there was also a guy that played guitar. And I thought he was so lucky. But then I didn't ask anybody if I could play guitar. If I could take classes.

And nobody asked me. Like my mother. She knew I loved music. But they didn't entice me. I'm mad. I'm fucking pissed. And yeah. I ended up like in the second grade of high school.

We ended up going to like. I ended up going to another. Getting kicked out of the dormitory. Because I got into trouble with the guy there.

That was looking. Looking after us. And I went to. I went to another college. Another private high school. But that was a bad one.

Because it was the private school. That everybody that got kicked out. From other private school. That had behavior problems.

Went to that school. It was like the jail of private schools. And I tried to not get in actually. I messed up the entry exam.

By like. By purpose. And when I got home. And when we got the. The entry. Exam. Result. My parents. Made it on fucking purpose. They're fucking losers. My parents are fucking losers.

I'm fucking pissed. I'm fucking pissed now. Because I. They made it on purpose. They said. And they hadn't done that before. For the other college.

But they did it there. For. They. Make a big. They made a big. Like. Some. Some decorations. To congratulate. My brother. My twin brother. On his results. Because he got in. And he had a good result.

And they knew. I made it on purpose. To mess up the exam. So they were. They were mad at me. And that's why. The congratulations. Did my brother. And told him. How good he was.

Just to piss me off. Because I was pissing him off. They just wanted to get back. Fucking loser parents. Fucking hate them. Fucking hate them. Fucking losers. Just thinking about it right now.

I'm getting so mad. So fucking mad. Of course. I can't. How can I have good self-esteem? Fuck. They treated me like shit. Like that. I'm a fucking kid.

Fucking losers. They're not there. And then when I mess up. Or I'm not okay. They just tell me I mess up. Instead of telling me.

How good I am. They don't. They don't recognize my talent. They don't recognize how fucking awesome I am. And then they. They recognize. Like. When I fucking mess up.

Fucking losers. I wanted to. Talk about my professional experience. And. I end up talking about my parents. But I guess the two are late. Fucking mad. Now I was at the point where. Yeah. I was explaining. My. My. My. My. Yeah. My parents. Congratulations. Did my butter. But.

Since I had such a great. Admission test. When I went to. To. Get the admission. At Dremus. I. Actually. I remember doing the test.

I remember. Both tests. I remember. Hey. I love that thing. I love doing that thing. I'm really good at that. So I guess I had a really good test.

Because. When I was doing it. I. I remember. Being good at it. And. Finding it was easy. And knowing. The good question. The good answers actually.

So. Yeah. Because of my test. At Breve. They. Accepted me at the other college. Which. Is. Bourget. Bourget. And. When I went there. They didn't have. It's. Totally different experience. Because it's. Boys and girls. And. The guys there are not nerds.

They're a lot more violent. And. So. I remember there too. I saw a guy playing guitar. And I was so jealous.

I wanted to play guitar. And. I didn't know who to ask. And I didn't have. The guts anymore. To ask anybody. Because. I wasn't shown. It was possible. When I asked people stuff.

I wouldn't get one my way. So. The only thing I could do. Is. I guess. Lie to people. Lie to. To. To authority. To. Get out of shit. I couldn't get my way.

To have. To have shit. And. I stayed. We stayed there for two months. But. While we stayed there. Like. I remember. Having. Art class. And. We had to reproduce. Or to do. An Indian painting. That was. That was. Inspired by some Indian paintings.

And. I remember. After doing my painting. Looking at the other paintings. And. Knowing mine was like. Okay. I'm doing exactly the same style.

As the original artist. But it's an original one. It's a new one. And. I was really proud of myself.

There too. But anyways. It's something that. I only remember. Because. Yeah. Who was there to. To give me. Praise me about that. I don't know. Nobody. So we got kicked out. My brother went to.

Enrich class. And I went to a normal. Public high school class. Because. I told my brother I didn't mind. And he didn't want to be in my class.

So. That's what happened. It was a shitty choice. Because. Public high school education. Is like the most boring thing you can have. Actually. I was so bored.

I got totally depressed in high school. And. Like. At first I had really good grades. I remember having like 100% in physics. And I loved physics.

I thought it was cool. But I. I really got bored. And. Yeah. It was a waste of time. It was a total waste of time.

And. I almost flunked actually. My. My last. High school grade. Because. I couldn't spend it anymore. I was just too bored. I didn't go to school.

I smoked pot in the school. And. Or. While I was at school. And. I was so. Totally depressed. I didn't know where I was going. I had no self-esteem.

No. When I look. Afterwards. It's something I learned recently. That. Like. Self-assertion is. Is a link to. To self-esteem. And it's one of the pillars of self-esteem. And I had lost all self-assertion. From there. Because. I was actually. Stepping on myself. And. Just. Not.

Asserting myself. Not telling people. What I wanted to. To do. Who I was. And. What I wanted. There would have been. Some opportunities. In high school. To do. Shows and stuff. And. But. But. Actually. I did one. I did. The high school. The. In. Last grade of high school.

I did. The fashion show. And. I had almost a standing ovation. It was amazing. It was really nice. I loved it. And. I really felt alive. But for the rest.

Like. I failed math. Then took the summer class. Because. I wanted to go to. I. I wanted to continue education. So. And. Like. I had 90. In the. Summer class. So. Math. And. Strong math. For. High school. So. Math wasn't a problem.

It's just the boredom. That was the problem. And. I was out of it. At the same time.

In the last year of high school. I was taking. Accutane. Which was. A medication. For. Pimples. And. It was bad. Because. It got me. Really depressed. So. Yeah. A bunch of things were happening. I had stopped. Drawing. Because when I was in the. First grade of high school.

I was drawing all the time. Like. In PMF. I was drawing all the time. And. Everywhere. In my. Workbooks. And. I was getting pretty good. But when I got into.

Public high school. I was kind of stressed. Actually. And I stayed stressed. For. Four years. It wasn't fun. It wasn't fun at all. But like. I was kind of one of the cool kids. But. Like. I wasn't stressed. Because. But. There were some. Kind of. More. Stronger kids.

Because. I was in. In. In my class. There were people that had. That had flunked. Their grades. Like. Two times. So. They were two years. Older than us. And. It makes a big.

Dynamic difference. Because they're not shy. With anybody. And. You kind of. You're shyer. That. That was totally different. Than Brebeuf. So. I really missed out. Like. I miss Brebeuf totally.

I thought. And when I asked my mother. To go back to Brebeuf. She told me no. Because she likes to decide things.

She just. She's just like that. She likes to decide. If I ask her something. It's no. If she says something.

Then. She says something. You know. Kiss. Damn. It's good to talk about it. Because I haven't talked about it. Nothing. And. So that's it. I didn't have much options. When I got out of.

Of high school. To go to. To CGEP. I. Because I. Didn't have good grades. And. I actually was. I was so. Like. I had no. I was so. Like. Procrastinator. I couldn't. I couldn't do anything. By myself. Like. I couldn't. Just like. Filled paper works. To get into university.

I couldn't do it. It was. Impossible. It's just. Too boring. I couldn't do it. But at the same time. In high school. I started. Playing guitar. That's. Like. We had a. Guitar class. In. In eighth grade.

When I got to public. High school. Public school. And I loved. I loved it. I played a lot. But at the time. Like. People were already good.

People had already started playing. And. I felt bad. So. Like. And I. Couldn't play in front of people. Because. I don't know. So I was shy. And so I wouldn't play as much.

But I still loved it. Like. And I think in. Ninth grade. In eighth grade. I got. I got. I got a guitar. I finally got a guitar.

And then. Actually. Yeah. My dad. Brought me a guitar. In eighth grade. But it was a guitar. From. A woman. He was seeing. Because he wasn't with my mother. For a while. And he gave me that guitar.

That. Like. It was unplayable. It was just unplayable. Like. There was no. The action was. Two inches. Above. And. It was like. Old. And not playable. So I. Got to play it. Good thing about my father. Is at that time.

Around. Eighth grade. He said. Okay. You guys should be in the ski competition. And. He. He bought us the equipment. And we went. Into ski competition. And. That was really good for us. For me and my brother.

It was a really good experience. I did that two years. I think. Nothing else major in high school. Actually. I was. I was making friends.

I had a bunch of friends. I was popular. Girls loved me. I was shy. I didn't. I was shy. As in me. You don't. You didn't have internet at the time. So. Maybe it started. And I. Yeah. At that time. I was playing. Computer games. On. My mother's computer.

And. I remember. At one. One time. I said. Those games are fun. I like to maybe. Program games. I thought I could program games. And. In. In 10th grade.

We had a class. A computer class. And. I was good at it. Like. I was. The best. Actually. One of the best. Me and another guy.

Like. We had fun. We. We had fun programming. Seeing things. Like. Entering numbers. And stuff. And seeing things happen. And. Another memory. I have from. High school. Is. Yeah. I. Actually. At one point. That. In. In ninth grade. I finally was in.

Enrich. In an enriched class. And. There was one. Crazy guy. That. I became friends with. Was. His name was Valeria. And he was crazy.

He was. Really different. Than a lot of people. And. Like. His. His. Parents. Were more into arts. And. He was. And. He played guitar. And. So I was playing guitar with him. And. We would listen to a bunch of music.

Like. The Doors. But also. A bunch of Pink Floyd. And. Also. Moonlight. Moonlight Sonata. And. A bunch of stuff. And. Talking about art. And. Yeah. It was really. Really fun. Really different with that guy. He became my best friend. Actually. But he was. Was out there. And. And he was.

Philosophizing. All the time. But. I thought. Were. Is. Is. Kind of. His type of philosophy. Was more. And. I couldn't really understand it. Because. Like. He was. He was shooting. Thoughts at me. It was. It was almost more creative. And. I would poke. Holes. In. In his. Theories.

But. Logical holes. That's what I remember. I think. It's. It's fun. To philosophize. But. I tell you. Like. He was more creative. Than anything. In his philosophy. But he was. Really intelligent. And. Mind. It was mind opening. For me. But. But. At the same time. It kind of.

Threw me off. My game. Because. Instead of. Playing cool. And being cool. With a bunch of. Kids my age. I started. Philosophizing. And. It's kind of. Like. It's an identity crisis. And. Because. You start questioning. Everything. And questioning. The way people are living. And. And you get. It gets deep.

And dark. And. And pretty bad. So. I really. I was totally nihilistic. At that time. Depressed. Nihilistic. And. I didn't really. Have. People. To talk about. About. Philosophy. Or. Or anything. So. Some good things. That I did. Some teachers. I was. Talking about them. About. I was talking to them.

About those things. But. I guess. They saw. Maybe. I was good at school. Like. I didn't. I was kind of. Intelligent. And. But. And I was a bit lost. And. So. Like. At one point. Francie Claude. A French teacher. Gave me a book.

And she said. I think you'd like that. It's. It was. Aldous Huxley. Brave New World. Loved it. Loved it. It still. It still. Hounds me. Sometimes. At times. You know. I still have it. In my mind. And. Another. Teacher. Gave me a book. He said. You should read that.

It was. It was kind of. A. Out there book. It was from. Was it Frédéric Bach? The Voyage of the Imaginary Messiah.

It was good. It was about letting go and following the flow of life. I should actually reread it, maybe. Another teacher gave me a book. The English teacher, she was kind of an ancient DP.

And she gave me the book. What was the name? It was Carlos Castaneda, The Teachings of Don Juan. Don Juan was also good, but I didn't really get it.

I think I should reread it because I didn't get it, I think, the way I would get it today. I thought it was more kind of a guy that would explain his drug trip. So I was like, what's the goal? Anybody can take drugs and hallucinate.

So I didn't think it was that good. And my father, too, at that time started suggesting some books. That made a difference for me, like psycho-sibernetics and stuff like that. So I decided to go to, finally, after high school, I decided to take a year off and go to Costa Rica in an exchange program.

Actually, I wanted to go. I was looking at it, but I was too depressed. And I guess I didn't have agency enough to fill the paperwork. So my father, at one point, got tired of seeing me, like, not doing anything and being bored and because then partying.

So he said, OK, you're going there. You're going to Costa Rica. So I went to Costa Rica. Oh, before that, I had, like, before going to Costa Rica, I had one semester to do at CGEP.

So I went to San Jose and human sciences, kind of liberal arts, liberal sciences. And I had one art class. And I did some really amazing drawing there. Really nice. Like, everybody said it was nice.

Really nice. So. And I was the best in class. And people told me, people told me I should do that. But not my father. He didn't see my drawing.

He didn't care about my drawing. At that time, I started, that was crazy. I started living with my father in Montreal. He decided to rent an apartment, finally, so we could live with him.

And he was never there. And when he got there, he kind of brushed us up, told us to get off the couch because he wanted to watch his news. He wouldn't ask us how it was going. He would just do his fucking thing.

Fucking user. I wasn't pissed at him. Now I'm pissed at him. I don't know why. I didn't realize how much of an asshole he was.

So then I went a year to Casarica. Yeah. I went a year to Casarica. I think that's important for my, to talk about, for my professional life. Because it was a revealing experience.

When I got there, I knew I wouldn't see those people again. And so I decided I would be totally myself and do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. So I would bring a guitar, play guitar in front of people. One thing is crazy is I wasn't good at basketball in Canada before I left.

And when I was in Casarica, I was playing with really good people. And I was good because I didn't care. I was just going at it and having as much fun as possible. I was good at soccer and I wasn't before.

And I was kind of almost a different person or totally myself, actually. And when I was there, we did some shows sometimes because all the exchange students with their family got together. And we had to do some sketches. And there were a lot of people.

There were like more than 100 people. And the sketches I did, like we prepared ahead. And some people came to, some people I didn't know came to talk to me afterwards. Telling me like, you should go in theater or something like that. You're so good. That was amazing.

So I really wanted to do that afterwards. I said, yeah, it's true. That's what I always wanted to do. That's still what I want to do.

But, you know, it's now I'm thinking about it. And I kind of failed myself. But I had a few opportunities. Like when I got back from there, I thought I'd go into acting.

My mother, when I was in Costa Rica, she enrolled me at the P-Jet Dawson College. Where in creative arts it was called. It was a cool program where I could get four concentrations in anything I wanted. As long as I had the background credit for the education program.

I could do anything I wanted. So I decided to take one in strong maths from CGEP. Like the strongest maths possible. So I could go to a university in computer science.

Because actually at that time, I liked to draw. I started. Because, oh yeah, another thing is when I was in Costa Rica, another thing I was doing is playing guitar all the time. Like to everybody. And it was fun. It was getting good.

I also drew a lot. Like all the time. I did some really, really nice drawings. And I got to do some shows.

And when I came back, I actually almost stopped drawing. Yeah. I think in retrospect, I shouldn't have hung out with the same friends. I should have cut the bridges. Because they kind of forced me to be someone I was in me with them.

So I was bad for self-esteem for sure. Because if I don't assert myself, I can't have self-esteem. So yeah. When I got back from Costa Rica, I did creative arts. I had good grades in math.

And I did German and communication. And that day, I went to the school play. But I wasn't the best in English. Like I have a big accent.

And the school play was in English. So I did get a small part, but important part. And I got a freaking stand innovation with my part. It was great. Freaking great. The last time I did a play, I was 20 years old.

No, 19 years old. Then I went to university. And I had totally stopped drawing by that time. I was playing some guitar, but not too much.

You know, I didn't have the same concept that I have now. Now I feel, at 47, I feel like life is really short. And it's getting faster and shorter. And I really need to, like if I want to get good at music, I have to do only that.

It's a bit late. It's too late. I kind of missed it. I'm still doing it because I love it. I don't care. Who's going to judge me in 100 years?

Nobody's going to remember me. So I'll do what I want. Anyways. So yeah. I was playing some guitar, though. I met some amazing friends at university.

I went to university afterwards in the computer science in Sherbrooke. I met some great friends. And what actually happened is in CGIP. I'll get back to this.
