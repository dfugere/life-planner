So my short-term goals are pretty simple. I don't want to focus on anything fancy or out of this work. First thing I want to do is just install some healthy habits and systems in my life. Just so that I get momentum and direction, actually.

So I think that's a good start. I keep doing my journal and improving. Improve it. Find a way to use AI to do the tedious things I'm not doing myself. And that makes me drop the things I want to do.

So I keep improving my accountability through the use of AI agents. So my goals are just to, at least five days a week, do the following things. 
- Keep my house in order. 
- Do my seven minutes mobility exercise.
- Go walk outside for at least 10 minutes while thinking and talking to myself. 
- Treat my nail my causes on my feet. 
- Journal  five minutes. 
- Meditate at least five minutes.
- Practice music or singing at least 10 minutes. 
- Monitor my finances at least 10 minutes. (I think that's going to be the hardest one. )
- work on my company at least three hours. 
- one week without consuming any content on my phone. 
- Work at least 10 minutes every day on building a personal AI assistant. 
- Read a book for at least 10 minutes. 
- I have a global plan for my life and business for the next six months.
-  I have a global vision for my life in business for the next year.
