## Patterns to Watch Today

_From [[Patterns-Growth]] — the ones that matter right now._

**Reinforce (keep doing):**
- Coming prepared (band practice mindset → apply everywhere)
- AI-assisted focus sprints
- Physical activity when stressed

**Interrupt (watch for):**
- Reaching for phone when bored
- Avoiding boring-but-necessary work
- Making excuses instead of owning mistakes

---

## Open Loops

_Things floating in your head that need a home. Get them out. Sort them later._

- **Call parents about the $14K gift** — Julie didn't accept, need to explain the situation with transparency
- **Call life insurance company** — may have lapsed due to non-payment, check status
- Fix RM Dispatch server alert (stop 5am wake-ups)
- Talk to Julie about evening cleanup routine with girls
- Toenail care session (30 min) — schedule it
- Address interruption pattern with Julie (without triggering conflict)
- **Integrate Google Calendar with dashboard** (so events show up, don't miss meetings)
- Find a real solution to block YouTube/Facebook (current methods hackable)
- Work around "others in house → unfocused" pattern

## Notes to Self

_Anything you need to remember. Context you'll lose. Things you want future-you to know._

**Remember:**
- 47 is not too late. 50 is coming. Urgency is real.
- AI gives you leverage you never had.
- One new client = $20k+ lifetime value. The math is obvious.
- You're not behind — you're exactly where your story led you.
- The pattern is clear: you're yourself when you're not performing for others.
