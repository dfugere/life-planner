## Core Traits

### ADHD Profile
- Diagnosed by test + self-recognized around mid-30s after watching a documentary
- Not the hyperactive type — the dreaming, thinking, can't-focus type
- Stayed in chair but couldn't focus; always in my head
- Hyperfocus on things I love (drawing, music, innovation)
- Severe difficulty with boring tasks, homework, follow-through
- Procrastination is lifelong pattern
- More thinking than action

### Personality
- Intellectually independent from young age
- Happy-go-lucky, laughing at everything (until defenses built up)
- Sensitive, romantic, deeply connected to girls/women
- Can go very deep into subjects — feels alone because few can follow
- Either laid-back/relaxed OR extremely angry (working on anger lately)
- Creative, artistic, intuitive

### Addiction Patterns (in order)
1. **Internet content** (started ~2004) — YouTube, games, series, endless browsing
2. **Day trading/gambling** (2017) — Crypto, lost significant money
3. **Guitar buying/selling** (last 6 years) — 400+ guitars bought/sold, 50000$ profit, My work productivity paid greatly. 
4. **Phone/content** — Ongoing, managing with grayscale, deleting apps

**Current status:** Cleaner for ~3 months. Apps deleted. Aware it's dangerous territory.

## The Self-Esteem Story

### Early Years (Before High School)
- Naturally talented at drawing — felt I was the best of anyone I knew
- Understood observation drawing intuitively
- Happy, laughing, not defensive
- Would say anything to make people laugh, wanted to be a clown
- Intellectually independent, didn't care if people laughed at me
- Could have intense anger episodes but they were rare and temporary

**The Unseen Artist:**
- Asked mother for a piano repeatedly — she insisted on classes first (solfège, classical rigidity). I wanted to tinker and learn music my way, not the rigid way. Never got the piano.
- 1st/2nd grade: Wrote a poem for Father's Day that teacher read aloud to the class. I was incredibly proud — knew it was the best in the class. Father's response: "Oh, you did a poem, good boy, that's cute." No recognition. I was devastated. *"This is so fucking good. What's your problem?"*
- Mother praised drawings, put them on her store wall. Father never acknowledged them.
- **Pattern established early:** Creative talents went unseen by the people whose validation mattered most.

**School Struggles (Early ADHD Signs):**
- In class: excellent — understood fast, remembered everything when people were around
- Homework: impossible — couldn't focus alone, would stare around the room
- 2nd grade workbook incident: Year-long arithmetic workbook. Wasn't hard, just tedious. Couldn't make myself do it. When it was due, I tore it up and put it in the fireplace kindling, half-hoping mother would find it. She did. I lied ("I don't know what happened"). Got believed. Had to do it in one day while others had fun. Got a good grade.
- **Patterns born:** Procrastination, can't-do-boring-things, lying to escape consequences

### The Shift (High School Years)

**Brébeuf (7th Grade, 1991) — The Best Year:**
- Got into the enriched class at the best private high school in Quebec (Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal)
- Lived in the dormitory. Father worked in Montreal but rarely came to see us — maybe dinner once a week. When he did, he criticized me for getting detention, never asked how things were going.
- Art teacher: *"You have crazy talent."* Did a self-portrait that looked like a photograph.
- Best in art class. Drawing all the time — in workbooks, everywhere.
- Tried improvisation — made everyone laugh, loved it, should have joined the team.
- Saw a guy playing guitar and was jealous. Didn't ask for lessons. Didn't know who to ask. Had stopped asking for things.
- Tried to get kicked out to be with friends at public school back home. Succeeded (behavior, not grades).
- **In retrospect: This was meant for me. I should have stayed.**

**Bourget (8th Grade) — Two Months:**
- Private school for kids kicked out of other private schools. "The jail of private schools."
- Intentionally bombed the entry exam to not get in. Parents saw through it — made a big celebration for my brother's results to punish me. *"Fucking losers."*
- Got in anyway because of my Brébeuf admission score.
- Did an amazing Indian-style painting in art class. Knew it was the best. Who was there to praise me? Nobody.
- Only lasted two months.

**Public High School (Grades 8-11) — Depression:**
- Brother went to enriched class; I went to regular (he didn't want to be in my class, I said okay).
- Public school curriculum: mind-numbingly boring. Got totally depressed.
- Had good grades initially (100% in physics) but couldn't bear the boredom.
- Last year: Accutane for acne made depression worse. Smoked pot, skipped school, almost flunked.
- Failed math, took summer class, got 90% — math wasn't the problem, boredom was.
- Fashion show senior year: almost got a standing ovation. Felt alive for a moment.
- **Stopped drawing.** Too stressed, in the wrong environment.
- Friend Valeria: philosopher type, listened to Pink Floyd and The Doors together. Mind-opening but threw me into existential crisis and nihilism.
- Teachers noticed something — gave me books: *Brave New World* (Huxley), Carlos Castaneda, Frédéric Bach. Father gave me *Psycho-Cybernetics*.

**Lost self-assertion:** Couldn't ask for what I wanted anymore. Mother's pattern of convincing me otherwise had trained me to stop asking. Just lied to get out of trouble instead.

### The Pattern
- When alone or abroad: myself, creative, drawing, writing, happy
- When with friends/family: defensive, not creative, not myself

**Evidence:**
- First year high school (Brébeuf, alone): Drawing all the time, in my element
- Costa Rica exchange year (18, alone): Best year of my life. Writing songs, performing, standing ovation, girls chasing me, felt like a star
- Return home: Deep depression, couldn't be myself

### The Six Pillars Framework
I'm organizing my growth around Nathaniel Branden's Six Pillars of Self-Esteem:

1. **Living Consciously** — Seeing reality as it is
2. **Self-Acceptance** — Accepting myself as I am
3. **Self-Responsibility** — Owning my life, no one is coming to save me
4. **Self-Assertion** — Being who I am without changing for others
5. **Living Purposefully** — Goals aligned with values
6. **Integrity** — Doing what I say I'll do

**Current progress:** Much better on acceptance and assertion. Working on integrity (follow-through).

## Romantic History

Romance has always been central to my life:
- Age 4: Ran after and kissed a girl in kindergarten, said I'd marry her
- Always had one girl I was intensely focused on (not multiple)
- Third grade: Group of second-grade girls in love with me
- Always had many girl friends, easy to talk to women
- Connections felt deeper than just physical — something unexplainable
- Partner now is the same girl from age 4 — finally together after her 30th birthday

### The Meditation Story
Around 2003-2004, doing active meditation. Read Tony Robbins advice to describe who you want in your life. Closed eyes, visualized the girl. Met her that weekend. Realized the next week it was the exact same girl. She was in love, I was in love. Changed my understanding of manifestation/intuition.

---

## Creative Life

### Drawing
- Natural talent from early age
- Art teacher at Brébeuf said I had "crazy talent"
- Observation drawing came intuitively
- Stopped completely in high school with friends
- Resumed when alone (Costa Rica)
- **Goal now:** 10 minutes daily to compound improvement

### Music
- Always wanted to be a musician (told parents from earliest memory)
- Asked for piano, mother insisted on classes first — I refused because I wanted to tinker
- Started guitar in second grade high school
- Brother would mock my playing constantly
- Father got me an unplayable guitar (2-inch action)
- Kept playing anyway
- Songs come naturally when I pick up the guitar

**The "Too Late" Belief:**
- Stopped myself from practicing more because I told myself it was already too late
- Saw people my age who were already much better — believed I could never catch up
- FOMO about missing time with friends when practicing
- Negative self-talk during practice even though I loved it
- Integrated the belief: "I have no talent, this is useless"
- **The truth:** This was a lie I told myself. The band proves it was never too late.

**Current:**
- Playing in a band with university best friends for one year
- Monthly band practice sessions
- Working hard at vocals + guitar parts, coming prepared
- Finally living the dream of singing with a band
- **Goal:** 30 minutes daily singing practice (including in car)

### The Band
- Drummer: Best friend from university, perfectionist, really motivates me
- I carry the most of the load because I want it to work. 
- This is self-assertion in action — my dream, finally pursuing it

---

## Professional Life

### Costa Rica Year (1996-1997, Age 18)
- Too depressed after high school to fill out paperwork for exchange program. Father finally said *"You're going."*
- Before leaving: One semester at CEGEP Saint-Laurent (human sciences). Art class — did amazing drawings, everyone said I should pursue art. Father didn't see them, didn't care.
- **Costa Rica changed everything:** Decided to be totally myself since I'd never see these people again.
- Played guitar in front of everyone. Played basketball and soccer well for the first time — because I didn't care, just had fun.
- Did sketches at exchange student gatherings (100+ people). Strangers came up after: *"You should go into theater. That was amazing."*
- Came back knowing I wanted to be an actor. Then went back to the same friends and became shy again.

### CEGEP + University

**Creative Arts at Dawson (1997-1999):**
- Mother enrolled me while in Costa Rica — Creative Arts program (four concentrations of my choice)
- Chose strong math (to go into computer science), German, communication
- Auditioned for school play (in English, with my accent) — got a small but important part
- **Standing ovation.** Last time I did theater — age 19.
- Had good grades, good momentum for the first time.

**Certificate in Computer Science (Université de Montréal):**
- Started studying well, got amazing grades (98% in math)
- Discovered: *"Now I'm a nerd. This is working."*

**Bachelor's in Computer Science (Sherbrooke, 1999-2003):**
- ~3.4 GPA. Could have been better but studying was still hard (ADHD).
- Loved: Logic, pseudocoding, Boolean logic, software theory, math
- Hated: Verbose languages (Java, C++, COBOL). Copied COBOL homework — thought it was worthless.
- **Self-image problem:** Didn't see myself as a "programmer nerd." Friends went to 3D/game programming internships. I went to boring management software internships.
- Space Agency internship: Did literally nothing. Zero lines of code. Was bored, intimidated, thought the problems were "not for me."
- In retrospect: grades were as good as friends who got cool jobs. Found proofs faster than them. Was plenty good enough — just didn't believe it.
- Made great friends. Played music for fun but never started a band (should have).

### First Jobs (2003-2006)

**Transportation Company (~2003):**
- First programming job. Building management software. Found it redundant — thought *"I should be generating this code, not writing it."*
- Got bored fast.
- **One heroic night:** New guy deleted database transaction log. Weeks of data lost, no backup. I stepped up, found a solution online, coded all night, recovered most of the data. Was the star of the show. *"That felt right."*
- Also discovered: Software you just buy on the internet. *"I should make that."*
- Left out of boredom. Started reading about internet marketing (2003-2004). Never actually did any marketing — too shy and scared. Still haven't done it 22 years later.

**Bar work (Summer 2003):** Worked at a bar, studied programming, got lost in tutorial hell.

**First contract:** Found a guy with an office in my building. He gave me a $10K fixed-price contract to build a software. Consultation agency did the requirements without me (mistake). Took over a year. Spaghetti .NET code with no tests. Learned a lot, made almost nothing.

### The Company (2006-Present)

**Founding with Benjamin (2006):**
- Met an INTJ French guy through brother's friends. Really bright — built the core of the transportation software.
- I found Ruby on Rails, showed it to him. *"This is better than anything — MVC, active records."*
- Good partnership: He focused and built fast, I found holes and explored new tech.
- Built transportation software for my old boss's company. Still running today — company makes $5-10M profit/year on our software. Currently migrating from Rails 2.3 to Rails 8 (with AI).

**R&D Credit Era (2009-2010):**
- Got $120K R&D tax credit coming
- Benjamin offered to sell his share for $10K. No-brainer — bought him out.
- Hired people thinking I'd find contracts to justify them. Poor management. Didn't find contracts. Wasted the money. Let people go painfully.
- *"I put myself in a bind financially and I'm still in it from that time."*

**Reservoir SaaS (2012-Present):**
- 2012: Friend had a surf school using WordPress. Built him a booking system on the train ride home — schema design + ActiveAdmin. $6K, one week, changed his life.
- Others saw it: *"We want one for lodging."* Built lodging version for $20K (at cost to gain traction).
- **Mistake:** Delegated schema design to Nicolas (lead programmer). Should have done it myself. His schema had flaws we're still paying for.
- Now: 100+ clients on Reservoir, our SaaS.

**Best Contract Ever — Arborist Software (2014):**
- $50K to build CRM → quotes → work orders → dispatch → time input → reporting.
- This time I was hands-on with Nicolas. Did most of the schema myself. Corrected his design decisions.
- **Delivered on time.** Client sent flowers. Couldn't believe it. Still loves the software.
- **Lesson:** When I'm stressed about something going wrong, I do my best work. When I'm comfortable, I drift.

**The Competitor (2020-Present):**
- Quebec City company (80 employees) decided to build outdoor activity software. *"Why isn't there good software for this?"*
- I saw them coming, thought our moat was too strong.
- They were better at: marketing, sales, onboarding, service.
- Since 2020: They onboarded 250 companies. We grew 2-3 per year.
- **Truth:** I hated onboarding clients. Tourism operators didn't know what they needed. Would complain about features, need endless training. I ghosted them. Word spread that our service sucked even though the software was amazing.

### The Working Dynamic

**What I'm good at:**
- Schema design and data modeling — seeing the abstraction clearly
- Innovation on the fly — fast ideas, good prototyping
- Finding problems before they become expensive
- Solving emergencies with focus and speed

**What I hate/avoid:**
- Tedious cleanup work, proper spacing/naming
- Client onboarding and hand-holding
- Sales and marketing (never done it despite knowing it would work)
- Following through on promises when bored

**With Nicolas (INFP):**
- Perfect complement: I prototype and innovate, he cleans up and systematizes
- He likes working from my models/designs
- Best work happens when I'm stressed about deadlines and stay hands-on
- When I delegate too much, things drift

### Current State

**The Pattern of Missed Waves:**
- 2004: *"I should start a podcast and interview songwriters."* Podcasts became huge 20 years later.
- 2004: Knew internet marketing was the gold rush. Never did any marketing. Still haven't.
- iPhone apps era: Could have built apps. Didn't.
- Bitcoin: Every crash said *"I should buy."* Too scared. Didn't.
- Ruby on Rails: Went to .NET conferences, told experts Rails was better. They stayed with .NET. I was right — but still didn't capitalize.

**The Puer Aeternus Pattern (Carl Jung):**
The archetype of the eternal boy who never grows into the hero:
- Never fully commits, so never fails publicly
- Lives in possibility instead of reality
- *"The hero that just doesn't grow to become a hero."*
- Recognizing this pattern helped me start making more decisions.

**The pattern that kills me:**
- Talk to client, promise something, know how to fix it, want to fix it
- Get distracted
- Two weeks later: not done, haven't answered the email
- Shame builds, procrastinate more
- Eventually do something magical that makes them forgive me
- *"It's an awful dynamic."*

**Current vision:**
- AI agents as the "clone army" I always dreamed of
- I know the domain, I know how to execute, I just don't do it
- With AI: can finally match execution to vision
- More confident now about asserting myself
- When clients criticize service, I agree and welcome it — because I have a plan to fix it

### Major Life Events
- 2009: Twin daughters born
- 2010: bought business from Partner, got R&D credit (~$100k) — financial high point
- 2014: Daughter diagnosed with leukemia (2 years treatment)
- 2017: Crypto day trading addiction, significant losses, financial troubles
- Present: More self-aware, using AI for leverage, motivated

## Financial History (Full Context)

### Early Relationship with Money

**Childhood patterns:**
- Around 8: Broke something in a store with a friend, paid for it myself from my bank account without telling parents
- Pattern: Felt alone, wouldn't ask parents for things, felt they wouldn't help
- When mother offered to buy me any toy: "No, I'm okay" — couldn't accept gifts
- Father (financial planner) once explained compound interest: "You could be a millionaire by 40 if you invest $2K/year" — but it felt stressful, not helpful. No guidance on how to actually get the $2K.

**Teen years:**
- $2/week from mother, $0.35 for errands
- Friends (Alexal, Jean-Philippe) were wealthier, hard to keep up
- First job at 14: dishwasher at restaurant
- Fired for being unsure about summer plans — boss said "Wait, you're not sure? Then you're not working."
- Student painting, odd jobs for mother's clothing store
- Never had much money for parties/bars

### Young Adult Years (18-25)

**Costa Rica year (1996, age 17-18):**
- Parents paid for exchange program
- Spent money on credit card while there
- Came back with debt

**University (CEGEP + university):**
- Parents paid school fees and apartment
- Worked as camp counselor, then boat captain
- No budget, not responsible with money
- Never investing, just spending

**First jobs:**
- Programmer at transportation company: $35K/year — felt low
- Got bored, went to work as bar boy (a bit more money)
- Left father's house, got $600/month apartment (a lot for me)
- Bought a car — financially hard
- Got fired from bar at end of summer

**Rock bottom (age 24-25):**
- On unemployment insurance (assurance chômage)
- Thousands of dollars in parking tickets — couldn't pay
- Had to work at charity at minimum wage to pay off tickets instead of jail
- Accumulating credit card debt
- Parents paid off $2K credit card debt

### Starting the Company (2003-2010)

**The beginning (age 25, 2003):**
- Got government subsidy for starting business while on unemployment
- No sales skills, didn't solicit clients
- Got a contract for $10K that took a full year of work
- Overdelivered, underbilled, took write-offs instead of billing clients

**Partnership with Benjamin (2006):**
- Met through brother's friends
- Great programmer and manager
- Built software for transportation company together
- Always cash flow problems
- Eventually hired 2 employees (barely justified)

**Tribal Nova contract:**
- Took a full-time job through the company
- Made ~$100K/year — first time making good money
- Lasted 6 months, then back to the struggling company

**High point (2009-2010):**
- Had kids
- Got R&D tax credit (~$120K)
- Bought out Benjamin, became 100% owner
- Had money, went traveling with family
- Started investing in mutual funds for first time
- One of the only times I was optimistic about money

**Poor decisions:**
- Hired more people to get more tax credits
- Wasn't a good manager — people weren't working on the right things
- Wasted the money, back to same situation
- Julie (partner) lost her job while pregnant, was on employment insurance

### The Crypto Disaster (2017-Present)

**Getting hooked (2017):**
- Heard about Bitcoin at $1K, read white paper, believed it would change the world
- Started buying — it was beginning of bull market
- Watched it rise fast, got completely caught in the hype
- Started literally gambling on other crypto
- Making money in bull market, but not working on company
- Wasting time, not focusing on business

**The crash:**
- Bear market came, lost almost everything
- Reinvested more, lost more
- Started going into credit card debt to buy Bitcoin
- At first it worked — could resell, pay credit card, keep Bitcoin
- Then bear market made it a losing strategy
- Embedded myself deeply in debt

**The $60K mistake (2020):**
- Told Julie: "You really have to buy Bitcoin, it's going to the moon"
- She trusted me with $60K of her savings
- I didn't put it in Bitcoin — put it in a scam company with Bitcoin on balance sheet
- Made terrible moves, lost almost all of it
- "Since then, we haven't been the same couple"
- Deep shame — she trusted me and I did all the wrong moves

**The pattern repeated:**
- Had $13K in another account, bought MicroStrategy and Bitcoin properly there
- That doubled to ~$30K
- But with Julie's money, couldn't follow my own plan — just made stupid trades
- Watched MicroStrategy come down, said "I should buy"... didn't buy
- When it went up, bought levered ETF at the height... lost everything
- "I almost wanted to kill myself. I feel disgusted."

**Stopped doing taxes:**
- Addicted to watching stock tickers online
- Let tax reports and payments slip
- Accumulated personal debt AND business debt to government

### Current Financial Reality (2026)

**Living situation:**
- 2-bedroom apartment in Montreal (Coolbrook Avenue)
- $1,700/month (good deal — includes usable basement/garage)
- Can't afford to buy a home
- Previously bought duplex with brother in 2007 for $236K — worth ~$1M now
- Sold it (missed opportunity)

**Personal debt (~$40K):**
- Visa credit card: $12K
- CIBC credit card: $7K
- RBC credit margin: $20K

**Personal assets:**
- ~$10K in sellable stuff (music equipment)
- ~$30K in investments (volatile)

**Company debt (~$130K):**
- Provincial government (taxes): $52K
- Federal government (taxes): ~$52K
- Bank loan: $60K
- Credit card: $17K

**Company assets:**
- $40K+ in receivables
- Software valued at ~$400K if sold (2x annual revenue)
- Annual revenue: ~$200K from clients

### The Path Forward

**What I know:**
- Each new client = $1K for 2 hours work
- Consulting rate: $150+/hour
- Marketplace flipping made $50K over 5 years — but opportunity cost was higher
- If I just focused on business, I'd make far more

**The realistic vision:**
- Current: $200K/year, ~100 clients
- Double to 200 clients → $400K/year (same 2-person team with AI)
- Double again → $800K/year
- Raise prices slightly → $1M/year

**Timeline:** 2 years if I focus. AI makes this possible.

## What's Working Now

### Mindset Shifts
- Six Pillars of Self-Esteem — the most helpful framework
- MBTI understanding (INTP) — accepted that being different is normal
- Alex Hormozi content — operationalizing concepts, "life is short, it's mine"
- Realizing: if someone doesn't support my dreams, they're not really my friend

### Current Practices
- Apps deleted (YouTube, Marketplace)
- Phone on grayscale
- ~3 months better at managing addiction patterns
- Band practice monthly
- AI-assisted productivity (highly motivated by this)
- Dictating thoughts (practicing English too)

### The 8 Daily Habits (from Better Ideas "Un-fuck Your Life")
Found this framework ~2 years ago. Resonates deeply because it's simple, actionable, and logical. These are the basics:

1. **Cleanse** — Get clean and dress sharp early, even working from home. Feels productive and disciplined.
2. **Sweat** — Exercise daily. Clears the mind, helps ADHD focus. Minimum 10 min/day.
3. **Venture Forth** — Get outside, see the sun, see people. Also means creating/sharing online — marketing, art, not just staying in mental loops. *Big one for me — not easy.*
4. **Order the Kingdom** — Keep environment clean. Mess → can't think straight. Make it a point to clean dishes, counters, everything. Not natural for INTP but critical.
5. **Monitor Your Treasury** — Track finances. *Currently avoiding this — finances are a mess because I don't do it daily.*
6. **Remove the Hooks** — Delete addictive apps, stop dopamine hijacks. Life is better without YouTube/Marketplace.
7. **Strategize** — This journal system. See reality clearly, have purpose, iterate and improve.
8. **Submit to the Things You Must Do** — Do the boring/tedious tasks. Kills momentum when avoided, feels amazing when done. The integrity pillar. *Working on this.*

**Self-assessment:**
- Strong: Cleanse, Sweat (building habit)
- Weak: Venture Forth (sharing/marketing), Monitor Treasury (avoiding), Submit (follow-through), Strategize, Remove the Hooks
- Variable: Order the Kingdom (improving)

### What I Know Now
- Compounding works: one year of band practice = massive improvement
- AI gives me leverage I never had
- 47 is not too late, but 50 is coming — urgency is real
- Focus beats everything else

---

## Patterns to Watch

### Negative (Interrupt)
- Avoiding boring but necessary work
- Last-minute crisis management (can always defuse the bomb, but shouldn't need to)
- Shame spiral when things slip
- Internet/content/shopping as avoidance
- Lying/making excuses when things fall through
- Not asserting myself around family/old friends

### Positive (Reinforce)
- Preparation for band practice (coming more than ready)
- Working in focused sprints when engaged
- Using AI for leverage
- Self-reflection and pattern recognition
- Physical activity (sports habit from father)
- Being myself when alone or with supportive people

---

## What I Want

### The Dream (Always)
- Popular actor and popular musician
- Creative work that matters
- Financial freedom
- Being fully myself with everyone

### Practical Goals Now
- 10 minutes drawing daily
- 30 minutes singing daily
- Build the business properly (sales, marketing, follow-through)
- Use AI to compensate for ADHD weaknesses
- Track everything (integrity pillar)
- Continue band, keep improving
- Stay clean from addictions

---

## Notes for AI

When working with David:
- He thinks by talking — let him process out loud
- He's practiced at lying and making excuses — call it out gently
- His memory is unreliable — write things down immediately
- He goes deep fast — match his depth, don't slow him down
- He has real talent he's underused — remind him of evidence
- The Six Pillars framework is his anchor — reference it
- His brother dynamic is painful — be aware of that wound
- He's 47 and feels urgency — that's motivating, not depressing
- He's been "almost" succeeding for 20 years — this time can be different with systems
