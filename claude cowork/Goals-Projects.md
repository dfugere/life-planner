## Active Goals

_These are the things that matter right now. Review weekly._

### 1. Build the Six Pillars Daily

**Why it matters:**
This is the foundation. Everything else depends on self-esteem. The book changed my perspective — now I need to live it daily.

**The Pillars:**
1. Living Consciously — see reality clearly
2. Self-Acceptance — accept myself as I am
3. Self-Responsibility — own my life
4. Self-Assertion — be myself without changing for others
5. Living Purposefully — goals aligned with values
6. Integrity — do what I say I'll do

**Current status:**
- [ ] Not started
- [x] In progress
- [ ] Almost there
- [ ] Done

**Daily practice:**
- Morning: Which pillar needs attention today?
- Evening: Did I live the pillars? Where did I slip?

**Progress log:**
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2025-01-18 | Started the system. That's integrity. |

### 2. Daily Creative Practice

**Why it matters:**
I've always been creative but kept abandoning it. Drawing and music are who I am. Compounding 10-30 minutes daily will make me unrecognizable in a year.

**Current status:**
- [ ] Not started
- [x] In progress
- [ ] Almost there
- [ ] Done

**The commitment:**
- 10 minutes drawing daily
- 30 minutes singing daily (including car time)
- Continue monthly band practice

**Target:** By March 4, 2026 (48th birthday) — noticeable improvement in both

**Next action:** Set up a simple tracking system for daily practice

**Progress log:**
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-01-19 | Car singing routine working! Using drive time alone with backing tracks and Zoom H1. Already getting better. |
| 2025-01-18 | Playing in band for 1 year now. Major progress on vocals. |

### 3. Grow the Business Properly

**Why it matters:**
20 years of almost-succeeding. AI gives me leverage I never had. One new client = $20k+ lifetime value. The math is obvious. Time to do the boring work.

**Current status:**
- [ ] Not started
- [x] In progress
- [ ] Almost there
- [ ] Done

**What needs to happen:**
- Systematize sales process
- Do actual marketing/publicity
- Follow through with clients (no more "slipping through")
- Use AI to compensate for ADHD gaps

**Next action:** Define what "systematized sales" actually looks like (with AI help)

**Progress log:**
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-01-19 | Work inbox backing up. Feeling overwhelmed → avoidance pattern. Need to use AI more to tackle this. |
| 2025-01-18 | Still gaining clients despite no marketing. Foundation is there. |

### 4. Sleep 7+ Hours Every Night

**Why it matters:**
Without enough sleep, focus is shit. ADHD gets worse. Work suffers. Everything is harder. Aiming for 8 hours to ensure at least 7.

**Current status:**
- [ ] Not started
- [x] In progress
- [ ] Almost there
- [ ] Done

**The commitment:**
- Aim for 8 hours in bed to get 7 hours sleep
- Track sleep hours daily in Daily-Log
- Notice patterns: what makes it harder to sleep on time?

**Next action:** Log sleep hours starting tomorrow (2026-01-20)

**Progress log:**
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-01-19 | Up too late (12:23 AM). Won't get 7 hours. Will pay for it tomorrow. |

### 5. Stay Clean from Addictions

**Why it matters:**
Content, trading, guitar shopping — all avoidance. Every relapse costs weeks of progress. 3 months clean now. Protect this.

**Current status:**
- [ ] Not started
- [x] In progress
- [ ] Almost there
- [ ] Done

**Current progress:** ~90 days of massive reduction (30hrs/week → ~10hrs/week on Marketplace)

**The rules:**
- YouTube deleted
- Marketplace deleted (again as of 2026-01-19)
- Phone on grayscale
- No trading apps
- If I install any of these, I log it immediately and delete

**Triggers to watch:**
- Boredom + phone access
- Stress without outlet
- Avoiding boring work

**Next action:** Keep logging. Don't get complacent.

**Progress log:**
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-01-27 | RELAPSE: Bought another guitar ($300). Wasted 1hr 45min. Fell into YouTube/Facebook/Marketplace. Deleting apps again. Pattern came back hard. |
| 2026-01-19 | Went on Marketplace 1hr today (avoidance when overwhelmed). Deleted it again. Progress: 30hrs/week → ~10hrs/week over 90 days. Mind is clearer. Goal is zero. |
| 2025-01-18 | Apps deleted. Aware it's still dangerous. |

### 6. Build Daily Healthy Habits (5 days/week)

**Why it matters:**
Install momentum and direction through simple daily practices. Use AI for tedious accountability so the system actually sticks.

**Current status:**
- [ ] Not started
- [x] In progress
- [ ] Almost there
- [ ] Done

- [ ] Keep house in order
- [ ] 7 min mobility exercise
- [ ] 10 min walk outside (thinking time)

- [ ] 10 min music/singing practice
- [ ] 10 min finance monitoring (hardest one)

**Bigger Goals:**

**Next action:** Start tracking these daily. Build one habit at a time.

**Progress log:**
| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
