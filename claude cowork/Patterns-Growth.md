## Patterns to Reinforce

_Things that work when I do them. Keep doing these._

### Coming Prepared (Band Practice)

**What it looks like:**
Practicing songs until I can't mess up. Arriving more than ready. Setting up the drummer (perfectionist) to be motivated.

**Why it matters:**
When I prepare, I perform. The band works because I carry the organizational load. This is self-assertion and integrity in action.

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance |
|------|----------|
| 2024-present | One year of monthly practice. Massive vocal improvement. |

**Reinforcement strategy:**
Apply this to other areas. If it works for band, it works for business.

---

### Physical Activity

**What it looks like:**
Sports, movement, getting out of my head and into my body.

**Why it matters:**
Dad's gift. When I move, I feel better. It breaks rumination and shame spirals.

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance |
|------|----------|
| Lifelong | Sports always made me feel better |

**Reinforcement strategy:**
When stressed or avoiding, default to movement first.

---

### Being Myself When Alone/Abroad

**What it looks like:**
Costa Rica. First year high school at Brébeuf. Any time away from old friend dynamics.

**Why it matters:**
This is when I'm creative, happy, drawing, writing songs. The pattern is clear: I'm myself when I'm not performing for others.

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance |
|------|----------|
| 1996 | Costa Rica exchange — best year of my life |
| 1992 | First year at Brébeuf — drawing, happy, felt at home |
| Present | Writing songs when alone |

**Reinforcement strategy:**
Protect alone time. Reduce time with people who trigger defensive mode. Spend more time with people who let me be myself.

---

### AI-Assisted Focus Sprints

**What it looks like:**
Using AI to get leverage. Delegating the boring parts. Getting into flow because the friction is lower.

**Why it matters:**
This is new. AI compensates for ADHD gaps. 2-10x more productive when I use it well.

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance |
|------|----------|
| 2025-01-18 | Set up entire life planner system in one session |

**Reinforcement strategy:**
Start work sessions by talking to AI. Let it hold context. Don't try to remember everything myself.

---

## Patterns to Interrupt

_Things that derail me. Watch for these._

### Avoidance Through Content/Shopping

**What it looks like:**
Installing YouTube, Marketplace, trading apps. "Just checking" becomes hours. Days lost.

**Early warning signs:**
- Boredom without purpose
- Stress I don't want to face
- Phone in hand with nothing specific to do

**What triggers it:**
- Boring work I'm avoiding
- Shame about something I dropped
- Unstructured time

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2017-2023 | Multiple relapses | Lost years |
| Oct 2024-present | 3 months clean | Deleted apps, grayscale |
| 2026-01-27 | Relapse: Guitar purchase $300, YouTube/Facebook/Marketplace | Logged it, deleted apps again, back on track |
| 2026-01-29 | Thursday relapse: Marketplace/YouTube while exhausted and unfocused | Identified the "no committed priority" trigger |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Apps stay deleted
2. Phone stays on grayscale
3. When urge hits, move body instead
4. If I install, I log it IMMEDIATELY and delete

---

### Last-Minute Crisis Management

**What it looks like:**
Procrastinating until everything is about to explode, then heroically saving it at the last second.

**Early warning signs:**
- Knowing something is due and not starting
- Feeling the pressure build
- Telling myself "I work better under pressure"

**What triggers it:**
- Boring tasks
- Things I don't know how to start
- Unclear next actions

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Lifelong pattern | Always defusing bombs at last minute | |
| 2025-01-18 | Starting this system BEFORE crisis | Prevention |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Break things into tiny next actions
2. Start with 5 minutes — just 5 minutes
3. Use AI to hold context so I don't have to ramp up each time

---

### Excuse-Making / Lying

**What it looks like:**
Making things slip through look like accidents. Manipulating perception instead of owning mistakes.

**Early warning signs:**
- Crafting explanations before being asked
- Avoiding client communication
- Relief when something "slides"

**What triggers it:**
- Shame about forgetting/dropping something
- Fear of confrontation
- Pattern learned in childhood (the workbook story)

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Second grade | Tore up workbook, made it look accidental | |
| Present | Still happens with clients sometimes | |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Own it immediately. "I dropped this. Here's what I'm doing about it."
2. The shame of lying is worse than the shame of admitting
3. Clients forgive honesty. They don't forgive patterns of deception.

---

### "Too Late" / Comparison Self-Sabotage

**What it looks like:**
Telling myself I can't catch up, others are already too far ahead, I have no talent, it's useless to try. Stopping myself from doing things I love because of comparison.

**Early warning signs:**
- Comparing myself to people who started earlier
- FOMO about "wasted time" if I practice instead of socializing
- Negative self-talk during practice even while enjoying it
- "What's the point?" thoughts

**What triggers it:**
- Seeing someone my age who's better
- Thinking about how long I've "wasted"
- Brother's voice in my head mocking me

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| High school - 40s | Stopped myself from practicing guitar more | Believed the lie |
| 2024 | Started band anyway at 46 | Proved the lie wrong |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. The lie: "It's too late, I have no talent"
2. The truth: I started a band at 46 and improved massively in one year
3. Compounding works at any age. 10 minutes today > 0 minutes.
4. Comparison is irrelevant — I'm not competing, I'm living.

---

### Defensive Mode Around Family/Old Friends

**What it looks like:**
Not being myself. Playing status games. Can't share music with brother. Can't be creative.

**Early warning signs:**
- Feeling guarded
- Pre-filtering what I say
- Not mentioning things I care about

**What triggers it:**
- Brother mocking me
- Old friend dynamics
- Anyone who knew "defensive me"

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| High school | Stopped drawing when with friends | Was myself when alone |
| Present | Can't tell brother about music | Tell supportive people instead |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Limit time with people who trigger this
2. Have a version of myself I protect — they don't get to see everything
3. Spend more time with people from band, from Costa Rica era, who know real me

---

### Comparison → Shame → Depression → Relapse

**What it looks like:**
Hearing friends talk about their financial success. Comparing myself. Going silent. Feeling like a failure. Then reaching for comfort (content, shopping, avoidance).

**Early warning signs:**
- Friends discussing finances, retirement, comfort
- Going quiet instead of participating
- Feeling "behind" or "different"
- Tiredness + shame = high risk

**What triggers it:**
- Band practice with successful friends
- Any reminder of financial gap
- Poor sleep lowering defenses

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2026-01-27 | Band practice: GP can retire, Philip is comfortable. Went silent, felt depressed, bought a guitar ($300), fell into YouTube/Facebook | Journaled about it, identified the chain, back on track next day |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Notice when going silent — that's the first warning
2. Speak up anyway, or leave the conversation
3. Remind: their path is not my path
4. Julie's voice: "You're intelligent, you have a company, beautiful family"
5. Tired + shame = DO NOT TOUCH PHONE

---

### Shame as First Reflex

**What it looks like:**
Something happens (parents, failure, dropped ball) → immediate shame response → then need to consciously reframe.

**Early warning signs:**
- Feeling stupid, like a loser
- Father's voice in my head
- Wanting to hide or avoid

**What triggers it:**
- Parents (especially father's implicit criticism)
- Financial problems
- Things I dropped or forgot
- Any comparison to where I "should" be at 47

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2026-01-28 | Parents' gift situation. Shame hit first. | Paused, reframed: "I'm human. Everyone has weaknesses. I can work on this." |
| Lifelong | Father's criticism → shame → freeze | Tim Fletcher insight: complex trauma pattern |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Notice the shame when it hits
2. Pause. Take a breath.
3. Reframe: "I'm human. This is a weakness I can work on."
4. Don't let shame become identity
5. Transparency is the antidote — be upfront, don't hide

---

### No Committed Priority → Scattered Day

**What it looks like:**
Waking up without ONE clear thing to do. Constantly reprioritizing. Starting things, switching, never finishing. The whole day evaporates.

**Early warning signs:**
- Asking "what should I work on?" multiple times
- Feeling like there are too many things to do
- Jumping between tasks without completing any
- "Productive procrastination" — fixing guitars instead of work

**What triggers it:**
- Exhaustion (lowered decision-making capacity)
- No clear deliverable or deadline
- Multiple equal-priority items
- Not deciding the night before

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2026-01-29 | Thursday: ~2 hours work, repaired guitars, practiced guitar, wasted rest on Marketplace/YouTube | Should have picked ONE thing in the morning |
| Lifelong | Pattern shows up when tired + no clear goal | |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Decide on ONE priority the night before
2. Write it down — make it non-negotiable
3. If exhausted: pick the easiest important thing, not the hardest
4. When catching myself switching: STOP, go back to the ONE thing
5. "Productive procrastination" (fixing things, organizing) is still procrastination

---

### Others in House → Unfocused

**What it looks like:**
Someone else speaking in the house. Using speech-to-text. Feeling shy about doing work. Totally losing focus.

**Early warning signs:**
- Hearing others in the background
- Hesitating to speak for dictation
- Switching to less productive tasks

**What triggers it:**
- Julie or daughters home while working
- Feeling observed or overheard

**Evidence log:**
| Date | Instance | What I did instead |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| 2026-01-28 | Noticed I get unfocused when someone else is here, especially for speech-to-text work | Logged the pattern |

**Interrupt strategy:**
1. Work in a different room with door closed
2. Use headphones (signal to self and others: working)
3. Push through the discomfort anyway — the work matters more
4. Or: save speech-to-text work for alone time
