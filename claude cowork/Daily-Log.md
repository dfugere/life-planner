## 2026-01-30 (Friday)

**Energy:** 🟨🟨⬜⬜⬜
**Mood:** Reflective, tired but aware
**Sleep:** Poor — woke at 5am, couldn't fall back asleep

### Week in Review
- **Wednesday:** 10 hours of focused work — excellent day
- **Thursday:** ~2 hours work, exhausted, scattered, unfocused

### Morning Check-in (10:00 AM)
Couldn't sleep. Woke at 5am and listened to a video to try to fall back asleep. Didn't work, but the video was valuable — Prof Chiang Academy on social programming and how to free yourself from it.

**Thursday was rough:**
- Exhausted, couldn't focus on one thing
- Constantly reprioritizing, never committing
- Went to "fix" a PA speaker (wasn't really broken — just Bluetooth issue)
- Repaired 2 guitars
- 1+ hour guitar practice (Sublime — "Same in the End")
- Maybe 2 hours of actual work, rest wasted on Marketplace/YouTube
- **Pattern:** When I can't decide and commit to ONE thing, the whole day falls apart

**The Prof Chiang Framework (resonated):**
A 4-phase process to deprogram from social conditioning:
1. Days 1-7: Suspend moral reflexes, delay judgment of good/bad
2. Days 8-14: Replace opinions with models — ask "how does this system function?" not "who's right?"
3. Days 15-21: Detach identity from belief — hold opposite positions without self-collapse
4. Days 22-30: Practice strategic silence — stop signaling values, observe without performing

This explains why I've always felt rejected — I naturally don't signal strong opinions, and that makes people uncomfortable. Now I have a framework for it instead of just feeling weird.

**Cost of awareness:** Freedom comes at the price of belonging, comfort, and simple stories. "Ignorance often is bliss."

**Financial history session:** Journaled for 1 hour about my entire financial history — building context for Moltbot AI assistant. Really looking forward to having it understand me better.

### Wins
- 10 hours focused work on Wednesday — that's real
- 1+ hour guitar practice
- Identified the "can't decide = lost day" pattern clearly
- Did the financial history journaling even when tired
- Excited about Moltbot — that's energy toward the right thing

### Struggles / Friction
- Thursday was mostly lost — Marketplace/YouTube relapse
- Sleep still disrupted
- The "can't commit to one priority" state is dangerous

### Patterns I noticed
- **No single committed priority → whole day scattered** (this is the key)
- **Exhaustion + no clear goal = high relapse risk**
- Guitar repair/practice as "productive procrastination" — feels useful but isn't the priority
- The journal habit is sticking even through bad days — that's integrity

### Open loops
- Still haven't called parents about $14K
- Still haven't checked life insurance
- Moltbot setup — send journal files

## 2026-01-28 (Tuesday)

**Energy:** 🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Mixed — stressed morning, productive afternoon
**Sleep:** Not mentioned

### Morning Check-in (9:11 AM)
Parents gave $14,000 for Christmas ($7K each to David and Julie) to help buy a home. Julie didn't accept the bank transfer — uncomfortable because of David's dire financial situation. Transfer expired, parents notified. Feeling the weight of having to call and explain.

**Family dynamics surfacing:**
- Mother: Says she understands but still tries to convince. Numbs you into going her way.
- Father: Makes me feel stupid, ashamed. Always been that way. Good at criticizing.

**Shame pattern identified:** Connecting with Tim Fletcher's work on complex trauma. Shame became part of identity. First reflex is still shame, but learning to pause and reframe: "I'm human. Everyone has weaknesses. I can work on this."

**Commitment to transparency:** Want to be straight with family/friends (not competitors). Being upfront about weaknesses is the move.

Big work day — deliveries due at 4pm. Stressed but good stress.

### Afternoon Check-in (5:51 PM)
Good focused day at work. Had a meeting, finished something important for client using AI. Sent video to client. Happy about my work day.

**New pattern identified:** Gets unfocused when someone else is in the house. Shy about doing speech-to-text work when others can hear. Need to work around this or push through it.

### Wins
- Good focused work day
- Delivered for client using AI
- Identified the "others in house" distraction pattern
- Journaling habit holding strong

### Struggles / Friction
- About an hour lost to internet content (LinkedIn, browsing)
- Family money situation weighing on mind
- Shame pattern still triggering first

### Patterns I noticed
- **Shame as first reflex** → then conscious reframe (progress!)
- **Others in house → unfocused** (new awareness)
- AI leverage making work more productive
- Transparency as intentional practice

### Open loops
- Call parents about the money situation
- Life insurance — may have lapsed, need to call and check

## 2026-01-27 (Monday)

**Energy:** 🟨🟨⬜⬜⬜
**Mood:** Depressed, tired, but fighting back
**Sleep:** Poor — didn't sleep well

### Morning Check-in (10:27 AM)
Band practice yesterday with university friends. Had a goal: do a full set as if it was a show. **It didn't go well.** Couldn't have done a show. New speaker/mixer didn't work well in the mix. Made a lot of mistakes.

**Comparison trigger hit hard:**
- Friends GP and Philip talked about finances before practice
- GP says he could retire if he wanted — made good financial decisions
- Philip is comfortable, wouldn't change his job
- I couldn't say anything. My reality is so different. I'm in debt. Every day is hard.

Felt rejected, depressed. Took a microdose of mushroom — felt weird, disorganized. Dream about friends passing me by and not wanting anything to do with me.

**Julie's perspective (this morning):**
"You shouldn't be depressed. You're intelligent. You have a company that just needs focus and work. You're healthy. Beautiful family. Everyone's healthy. Keep getting better and you'll be okay."

She's right.

**Refocusing:** Phone away. Excited about Claude. Want to clarify goals. 2 hours on financials.

**Life insurance worry:** Think I lost it because I stopped paying. Feel like a loser. Need to call the company.

### Evening Check-in (11:45 PM)
**RELAPSE.** Bought another guitar. Said I wouldn't buy any more. $300 — a good bargain, but still.

Wasted 1hr 45min going to get it. Wasted time on YouTube and Facebook. Didn't sleep well last night, hard to concentrate. Wasted a day. Spent too much time on Marketplace.

Deleting the app tomorrow again. Getting stressed, falling behind at work. Pattern coming back.

**But:** Made sure to log journal entry. Keeping the habit even when falling.

### Wins
- Journaled despite the hard day
- Julie's perspective landed — she's right
- Self-awareness about the pattern

### Struggles / Friction
- Band practice disappointment
- Comparison spiral with friends
- Guitar purchase relapse ($300, 1hr 45min wasted)
- YouTube/Facebook/Marketplace relapse
- Poor sleep affecting everything

### Patterns I noticed
- **Comparison → shame → depression → relapse** (the chain is clear)
- Poor sleep makes everything worse
- The guitar buying pattern is back
- Keeping the journal habit even when falling = integrity

### Tomorrow
- Delete Marketplace again
- Rise up. Be there for myself.

## 2026-01-26 (Sunday)

**Energy:** 🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Conscious, accountable, positive
**Sleep:** Not mentioned

### Morning Check-in (10:21 AM)
This new journal thing is great. Really makes me more conscious of how I live and use my time. Getting easier to stop distractions because I know I'm going to talk about it later — more accountable with myself.

**Weekend reflection:**
- Didn't waste too much time (some, but not too much)
- Played guitar at least an hour
- Learned to use new digital mixer
- Happy with Alto TS 312 purchase

Reading "4000 Weeks" — making a difference. More conscious of time, the sacrifice I need to make, that everywhere I am is my choice.

**Plan:** 4 focused hours of work, then band practice at 4:30. Need to clean (30 min), shower/get ready (30 min). That's realistic.

### Midday Insight (11:26 AM)
**Mindset shift:** I have access to as much resources as anyone in the world. It just depends on what I focus on, what I apply myself to.

The only reasons I can't get a lot more are psychological. Mental hurdles, emotional hurdles. Nothing real.

If I focus on executing, remove the emotional limits, stop the hallucinations I'm afraid of — there's no real limit.

### Wins
- Journal habit is working — more accountable
- Good weekend, not too much waste
- 1+ hour guitar practice
- Learned new mixer
- "4000 Weeks" insight: everything is a choice

### Struggles / Friction
- Still some time wasted (aware of it now)

### Patterns I noticed
- **Journal → accountability → better choices** (positive loop!)
- Reading is quietly shifting mindset
- Living consciously is happening

### What I'm doing now
Stopping journaling, going to do what needs to be done. Dashboard helped.

## 2026-01-25 (Saturday)

**Energy:** 🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Happy, connected, aware
**Sleep:** Not mentioned

### Check-in (10:59 AM)
Great weekend. Yesterday was too cold for skiing, daughters' lessons cancelled. We redid their room — took down the young kids' bed, set up real double IKEA beds. Took 8 hours but it was really fun spending the day with my daughters.

House is a mess now. Need to clean.

**Plans for today:**
- At least 1 hour music practice (jam tomorrow)
- At least 4 hours cleaning
- At least 4 hours updating financial statements, working on budget

**Financial reality check:**
- Finances are really, really bad
- Lots of debt, paying lots of interest
- Feeling trapped, not free
- Dragging Julie with me
- Julie unsatisfied with apartment
- Starting to want a house (never was a dream before)

**The root issue:** Not doing what I should be doing at work — selling more, focusing, delivering, growing the company. Been irresponsible with finances.

**Progress on addiction:**
- Removed apps from phone (YouTube, Facebook)
- Yesterday didn't look at phone at all
- Feels good. Really great.
- More brain trust for real personal challenges

**Six Pillars connection:**
Journal is helping with: Living Consciously, Integrity, Self-Acceptance, Self-Responsibility, Self-Assertion, Purpose. Generally good for self-esteem.

**Next practice:** Want to start 10 minutes meditation per day.

### Wins
- Great day with daughters (connection, presence)
- Apps removed from phone
- Didn't look at phone yesterday
- Journal making me more conscious
- Speaking English in journal (practicing pronunciation)

### Struggles / Friction
- Financial stress is real and heavy
- House is a mess (manageable)
- Feeling trapped by debt

### Patterns I noticed
- **No phone → feels good → more mental space** (the pattern is clear)
- Quality time with family = satisfaction
- Financial avoidance is still there but becoming more conscious

### Open loops
- Financial statements and budget work
- Talk to Julie about housing aspirations (aligned or not?)

## 2026-01-23 (Friday)

**Energy:** 🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Self-aware, slightly stressed
**Sleep:** Not mentioned

### Morning Check-in (12:30 PM)
Missed a 9am meeting with Larry because I was doing personal things and didn't check my calendar. Called her at 9:40 — no harm done. I was actually ahead of her in understanding her problem and gave her info she didn't even know.

The real issue: I have too many things to manage, can't prioritize, and end up frozen in the middle. When I can't decide between two things, I get stressed that whichever I don't do will suffer — so I avoid both. That's the worst outcome. Being conscious of this now.

**Six Pillars check:**
- Living Consciously: ✓ Seeing the pattern clearly
- Self-Acceptance: ✓ Accepting this is how my brain works
- Self-Responsibility: ✓ It's on me to change it

### What actually happened
- Had an appointment to sell a guitar neck from Facebook Marketplace
- That opened the door → got lost on Facebook → watched 1-hour Alex Hormozi/Tony Robbins video on YouTube
- Good video but entertainment, not business progress
- Tried again to block YouTube and Facebook but can always hack it

### Struggles / Friction
- Missed meeting (calendar wasn't in dashboard)
- Facebook Marketplace opened the door to distraction
- YouTube pull still there — "good content" is still avoidance
- Paralysis when facing multiple priorities

### Patterns I noticed
- **Marketplace appointment → Facebook access → YouTube spiral** (trigger chain identified)
- **Overwhelm → can't decide → avoid both → worst outcome** (core pattern)
- Dashboard is working — looked at it and it helped refocus

### Insight
"I really want only one dashboard to look at that I trust completely. If the system is set up right and priorities are clear, I wouldn't miss anything."

### Open loops
- Want Google Calendar integrated with dashboard so events show up automatically
- Still need a way to truly block YouTube/Facebook (can always hack current solutions)

### What I'm doing now
Stopping journaling, going to do what needs to be done. Dashboard helped.

## 2026-01-22 (Thursday)

**Energy:** 🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Frustrated/pissed but determined
**Sleep:** Woke up, couldn't get back to sleep — listened to Tim Fletcher video on complex trauma/shame

### Morning Check-in (10:26 AM)
Productive morning but no "work" work yet. Dropped kids at school, back by 8:50. Did full house ordering: kitchen cleanup (20 min — emptying/filling dishwasher, counters, everything), 10 min exercise (sweat + mobility), robot vacuum maintenance, set up basement office, shaved, light cleanup. All needed to be done.

Got distracted by girlfriend for 10+ minutes — completely lost track of what I was doing (ADHD). Feeling pissed about interruptions. Want to ask her not to disturb me but afraid she'll get angry ("I don't want to distract you, why do you say that?").

Realizing I can't get time back. Morning was productive (house ordering) — just not work hours. Ready for 4-hour flow state now.

### What I'm focusing on today
1. **4 hours of deep work** — no interruptions
2. Stay centered despite frustration

### Morning Wins
- Full house ordering done ("Order the Kingdom" practice)
- 10 min exercise (sweat + mobility) ✓
- No procrastination or wasted time — just necessary tasks taking longer than expected
- Self-awareness: caught myself getting emotional about not feeling heard — recognized the pattern

### Patterns I noticed
- Interruptions → ADHD derailment → forgetting what I was doing → anger
- Getting emotional/angry when wanting to be heard = complex trauma pattern (Tim Fletcher insight)
- Morning routines take real time — house ordering is ~45 min minimum
- Girlfriend creating kitchen mess → I clean it → frustration loop

### Open loops
- Toenail care (fungus treatment) — need 30 min session, schedule it
- Want to address interruption pattern with Julie without triggering conflict

### Insight from Tim Fletcher
Listened to video on complex trauma and shame. Key insight: feeling unheard as a child → shame → getting emotional/angry when wanting to be heard instead of calmly stating needs. "That's totally me." Something to work on.

### Evening Check-in (11:50 PM)
**Mood:** Accepting — "it is what it is"

**What actually happened:**
- **4-4.5 hours of work** (wanted 8)
- **3-3.5 hours of music practice** — getting better, sounding better
- Opened Marketplace (procrastinating, avoiding, waiting for Claude Code)
- Found Alto TS 312 speaker — normally $400, got it for $100
- Also got a recorder
- Went to pick it up — time spent

**Wins:**
- 3.5 hrs music practice — no discipline needed, love it
- Alto TS 312 FRFR speaker — actually useful for band shows
- AI-assisted work making more progress than previous weeks
- Self-aware: "I could do double the progress if more focused"
- Accepting: "It is what it is. I accept it."

**Struggles:**
- Marketplace opened again (avoidance pattern)
- Only 4-4.5 hrs work vs. 8 hr goal
- Got pulled into "good deal" hunting

**Patterns I noticed:**
- Waiting for AI → boredom → opening Marketplace (trigger identified)
- Music practice = effortless flow; work = requires discipline
- "Good deal" justification for Marketplace use
- Making progress with AI but leaving significant productivity on table

**Commitment:**
- Done with Marketplace. Done with YouTube. Has to stop.

## 2026-01-21 (Wednesday)

**Energy:** 🟩🟩🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Slightly anxious but ready to work
**Sleep:** ~7 hrs (good)

### Morning Check-in
Feeling good about yesterday — 9 hours of productive work and real AI progress. Did morning routine: 7-minute mobility exercise, cleaned up, singing warm-up, coffee, dressed. Starting a bit later than wanted.

Some anxiety around calendar meetings and things owed to clients (will handle in business planner). Calendar with meetings tends to mess with focus/orientation.

Noticed I looked at YouTube too much this morning — learned some AI coding stuff so maybe productive, but need to think about whether it was avoidance.

### What I'm focusing on today
1. 9 hours of work (ambitious but felt good yesterday)
2. Band practice at lunch — working on "The Kids Aren't Alright" (Offspring) specifically
3. Delete distracting apps from phone again

### Morning Wins
- 7-minute mobility exercise (daily goal: ✓)
- Morning routine completed (cleanup, singing warm-up, coffee, dressed)
- ~7 hours sleep (improvement from yesterday's 4-6)

### Patterns I noticed
- Meetings on calendar → disorientation/anxiety (known trigger)
- YouTube pull is still there, even when "productive"
- Exercise habit attempting to stick

### Open loops
- Client deliverables causing anxiety (tracking in business planner)

### Evening Check-in (11:59 PM)
**Mood:** Stressed, restless, a bit depressed — but aware of it

**What actually happened:**
- **7 hours of work** (logged at desk way longer)
- 10 minutes exercise ✓
- 1.5 hours guitar/singing practice
- ~1 hour Facebook
- ~1 hour YouTube
- ~1 hour Fallout (trying to relax)
- ~1 hour adult content

**Wins:**
- 7 hours of productive work (despite everything)
- 10 min exercise (hit the minimum)
- 1.5 hrs music practice — getting better, songs coming together
- Band practice Monday — feeling as ready as can be
- Self-aware about what happened today

**Struggles:**
- Couldn't concentrate, restless, anxious
- Lost ~4 hours to content consumption (Facebook, YouTube, Fallout, adult content)
- Feeling overwhelmed by work organization
- Depressed about how long it takes to get good at music

**Patterns I noticed:**
- No outdoor time → restlessness and poor focus
- Stress + overwhelm → reaching for content (old pattern)
- Adult content showed up — need to watch this
- Music practice: compound gains are real but the slow pace is frustrating

**What helps (noted for tomorrow):**
- WALK OR RUN OUTSIDE — didn't do it today and paid for it
- Should do outdoor activity every day

## 2026-01-20 (Tuesday)

**Energy:** 🟨⬜⬜⬜⬜
**Mood:** Tired but determined
**Sleep:** 4-6 hrs (woke up at 5am from server alert, couldn't fall back asleep until 7)

### Morning Check-in
Rough night. Server alert at 5am (RM Dispatch — happens every morning, need to fix that). Tired but aware of it. Know I need to be careful with phone/distractions today. Planning to use AI heavily to stay on track.

### What I'm focusing on today
1. Organize work stuff, get back to clients
2. Zero Marketplace, zero YouTube (except AI tutorials)
3. Maximize AI use for coding and process improvement

### Morning wins
- Sang in car for 15 minutes on the way back from school drop-off — voice is improving, hitting high notes easier
- 30 minutes kitchen cleanup before starting work
- Journaled (new dictation system working)

### Struggles / Friction
- Bad sleep affecting energy
- Server alert system needs fixing (waking me up daily)
- Frustration with AI/Cowork getting the time wrong earlier (was using Sonnet, not Opus)
- Need to talk to Julie about evening cleanup routine — feeling like she intervenes when I ask girls to help, wants to watch TV instead

### Patterns I noticed
- Low sleep = high risk day for phone/distraction
- Car singing routine still working — converting dead time to practice
- Morning cleanup habit is sticking
- Aware I need external support (AI) on tired days — good self-knowledge

### Open loop
- Need to fix RM Dispatch server alert so it doesn't wake me up
- Conversation with Julie about cleaning routine with girls

### Evening Check-in (11:27 PM)
**Mood:** Happy, enthusiastic, positive about tomorrow

**What actually happened:**
- **9 hours of work** — solid day
- 30 minutes music practice
- Paid credit card (personal finance done)
- ~2 hours YouTube (too much)
- ~1 hour Facebook (waste)

**Wins:**
- 9 hours of productive work
- 30 min music practice
- Personal finance task done (credit card paid)
- AI tools (Claude Code, Cowork, AI business manager) boosting productivity significantly

**Missed:**
- 10 min exercise (minimum daily goal — didn't do it)
- 10 min drawing

**Honest assessment:**
Could have been more focused — lost ~3 hours to YouTube and Facebook. But 9 hours of work is a strong day. The AI productivity gains are real and creating momentum.

**Energy for tomorrow:** High. Can't wait.

## 2026-01-19 (Monday)

**Energy:** 🟨🟨🟨⬜⬜
**Mood:** Tired but enthusiastic
**Sleep:** Not enough (up until 12:23 AM — won't hit 7hrs)

### What actually happened
Worked 5 hours at desk — wanted more but felt overwhelmed and got distracted. Work inbox filling up, need to tackle with AI help. Went on Facebook Marketplace for ~1 hour (avoidance pattern).

### Wins (even small ones)
- **Car singing practice routine working!** Driving kids to school, using the return trip alone to practice band songs with backing tracks on Zoom H1. Not wasting time on radio — actually getting better at singing. This is compounding fast.
- Good family day — lots of laughter and connection with girlfriend and daughters
- Marketplace usage way down from the 30hrs/week baseline (5 years of that pattern) — now ~10hrs/week, mind is clearer

### Struggles / Friction
- Felt overwhelmed → started avoiding work
- Didn't leverage AI as much as I could have
- Facebook Marketplace for 1 hour — the app is back and I need to delete it again
- Work inbox getting full

### Patterns I noticed
- Overwhelm → avoidance → distraction (Marketplace)
- The car practice routine is a win — converting dead time into skill-building

### Tomorrow
- **NO MARKETPLACE. NO FACEBOOK. Delete it.**
- Use Cowork to help clean up work inbox
- Set aside time to document financial situation and cash flow goals
